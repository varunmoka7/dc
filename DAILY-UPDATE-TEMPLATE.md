## **STYLE GUIDE:**

✅ **Keep it concise** - Bullets, not paragraphs
✅ **Be specific** - Names, features, customer names when relevant
✅ **Show learning progress** - What you learned, tried, or discovered
✅ **Always include "Next"** - Shows you're self-directed
✅ **Honest about blockers** - It's ok to say "still figuring out X"
✅ **Optional:** Casual vibe with emoji is fine (your team does this)
