# Meeting Tracker - Auto-Update Instructions

## How This Works

Whenever you ask me to:
- **"Book a meeting with [person]"**
- **"Schedule a 1:1 with [person]"**
- **"Add [meeting] to the calendar"**
- **"Review my meetings this week"**
- **"Check my calendar for conflicts"**

I will **automatically:**
1. Update `/docs/work/MEETING-CALENDAR.md`
2. Update relevant person's interaction file (e.g., `ALEX-RUDNICKI-interactions.md`)
3. Extract key details: date, time, duration, topic
4. Flag any timezone conflicts
5. Confirm the update with you

## What Gets Tracked

For each meeting, I capture:
- **Date & Time** (both your timezone and the other person's)
- **Duration** (30 min, 60 min, etc.)
- **Participant(s)** (who's involved)
- **Purpose/Topics** (what you're discussing)
- **Status** (pending, scheduled, completed, cancelled)
- **Recording** (Loom link when available)
- **Action Items** (from the meeting)
- **Notes** (key takeaways)

## Automatic Actions I'll Take

### When You Book/Request a Meeting:
```
Example: "Can you schedule my 1:1 with Veronika for Wednesday at 3 PM?"

‚Üí I will:
1. Add to MEETING-CALENDAR.md with status "‚è≥ PENDING"
2. Add to VERONIKA-interactions.md
3. Confirm: "‚úÖ Veronika 1:1 added for Wed Oct 29 at 3 PM Berlin (9 AM ET)"
4. Note any timezone warnings
```

### When You Review/Report on a Meeting:
```
Example: "I just finished my 1:1 with Alex, here's what we discussed..."

‚Üí I will:
1. Update MEETING-CALENDAR.md with "‚úÖ COMPLETED" + date
2. Update ALEX-RUDNICKI-interactions.md with full notes
3. Extract and list action items
4. Ask for Loom recording link
5. Mark all action items in todo list
```

### When You Ask to Check Calendar:
```
Example: "Do I have any conflicts on Friday?"

‚Üí I will:
1. Review MEETING-CALENDAR.md
2. Show all meetings that day with times
3. Flag overlaps or timezone issues
4. Suggest best time for new meetings
```

## Triggers for Auto-Update

I'll recognize these patterns and automatically update:

|---------|--------|
| "Book/Schedule [X] with [person]" | Add to calendar |
| "Can we meet [time] with [person]" | Add to calendar |
| "[Person] wants to meet [time]" | Add to calendar |
| "Just finished meeting with [person]" | Mark completed + add notes |
| "Here's what we discussed..." | Extract action items |
| "Do I have time for..." | Check calendar |
| "What meetings do I have this week" | Show calendar view |
| "Cancel my meeting with [person]" | Mark cancelled |

## Important Notes

- üìå **Timezone conversions** - I always show both your time and theirs
- ‚úÖ **Action items** - These feed into your todo list
- üîî **Reminders** - Tell me if you need a notification before meetings
