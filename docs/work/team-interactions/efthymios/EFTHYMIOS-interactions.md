## Key Interactions

### October 30, 2025 - Product Feature Demo & Interactive Dashboard Planning

**Meeting Details:**
- **Type:** Customer call with DitchCarbon
- **Time:** 3pm Berlin time
- **Attendees:** Alex Rudnicki, Varun Moka (DitchCarbon) | Efthymios (Pfizer)
- **Duration:** ~45 minutes
- **Note:** Elisa mentioned but not present (working with Maria on something)

**Context:**
- First time Efthymios met Varun (Varun's 3rd day at DitchCarbon)
- Varun specifically asked Alex to join Pfizer call (showed strong interest)
- Efthymios welcomed Varun warmly

**Key Topics Discussed:**

#### 1. Supplier Claim Profile Feature (Just Launched Oct 30)

**Efthymios' Strategic Framing:**
- Mentioned this feature idea from "long ago" but timing wasn't right previously
- **Now:** "I think now it's the right time I think you know to start like sending to supplier"
- Wants to "market it a bit better" to suppliers
- Goal: Showcase DitchCarbon's capabilities to suppliers who are serious about Scope 3

**Value Proposition He Sees:**
- Suppliers can self-serve (no more manual file transfers)
- Free value for suppliers (see scorecard, get recommendations)
- If suppliers serious about Scope 3 management → they can pay for DitchCarbon platform
- **Quote:** "If some of your suppliers are really serious about managing their suppliers, then they can pay us for that, just like you are."

**Alex's Alignment:**
- Offer Pfizer discount to Pfizer suppliers who want to buy platform
- Make it easy for suppliers to upgrade
- Everyone gets free value first

#### 2. Interactive Forecast Dashboard (Efthymios' Big Idea)

**The Vision:**
- Suppliers see their current trajectory based on public data
- Below forecast: 3-4 short questions (NOT long surveys)
- Questions trigger real-time forecast line adjustments
- Supplier sees "new trajectory" based on their planned decisions
- Can export/screenshot to share with internal leadership

**Example Questions Efthymios Wants:**
- "Based on current data, this is your trajectory. Is this realistic?"
- "Are you planning major capex/investments?" → If YES, forecast goes UP
- "Are you planning to withdraw from commitments?" → If YES, shift to pessimistic scenario
- "Are you planning reduction investments?" → If YES, forecast goes DOWN

**Additional Features Requested:**
- **Comment box** below each question (suppliers add context)
- **Attachment option** (suppliers upload supporting docs)

**His Reasoning:**
- Suppliers may not have **visualized their own trajectory** before
- Tool helps suppliers think through implications of their decisions
- Suppliers can use internally: "Here's what our path looks like" (show to CEO/leadership)
- **Brand value:** "Thanks to DitchCarbon" (suppliers appreciate the tool)

**Pfizer's Benefit:**
- Get **forward-looking information** (not just historical data)
- Understand supplier investment plans and intentions
- More predictive segmentation (beyond backward-looking)
- Reduce need for manual surveys/outreach

**Alex's Response:**
- "Totally doable"
- Timeline: **By end of year** (pretty realistic)
- Questions alone = sooner; full interactivity = more complex but achievable

**Technical Discussion:**
- Efthymios acknowledged challenge: Even he (Scope 3 expert) knows big picture (-25% by 2030) but can't predict intensity
- Agreed Scope 1/2 easier for suppliers to estimate than Scope 3
- Discussed sectoral/regional benchmark lines (not just supplier-specific targets)

#### 3. Peer Comparison & Confidentiality

**Varun's Suggestion:**
- Show supplier's data alongside peer data (same sector/region)
- Help suppliers benchmark themselves

**Efthymios' Response:**
- **Quote:** "This is a very tricky question in pharmaceuticals"
- Supplier name confidentiality = major concern
- Prefers **sectoral/regional commitments** over showing competitor names
- Wants to avoid confidentiality risks

**Solution Agreed:**
- Use industry/regional expected trajectories (e.g., "Pharmaceutical manufacturers in India")
- Based on: Grid decarbonization rates, material regulations, regional commitments
- DitchCarbon already has this data (used in Forecasting module)

#### 4. Monetization Strategy

**Efthymios' Suggestion:**
- Don't give suppliers **too much** for free
- **Quote:** "Give them something good, but don't give them too much"
- Hide comparison/benchmark tab unless supplier pays
- Sectoral benchmark = potential paid feature
- Free tier: Scorecard, trajectory, recommendations
- Paid tier: Scope 3 detail, benchmarking

**Alex's Response:**
- "I think that's a good suggestion"
- Main threshold: If suppliers want to manage **their own Scope 3 in detail** → must pay
- Pfizer discount available for Pfizer suppliers who upgrade

## Strategic Context: Pfizer's Supplier Engagement Philosophy

**Problem Efthymios Wants to Avoid:**
- **Survey fatigue:** Long 1-hour calls discussing sustainability with people who lack expertise
- Procurement/account managers talking about topics "barely know" or outside their "area of interest"
- People participating "because someone else asked them to do so" (not genuine engagement)
- Bureaucratic checkbox exercises

**Desired Approach:**
- Simple, actionable, non-bureaucratic
- Enable conversations without requiring deep sustainability expertise
- Provide value to suppliers (not just data extraction)
- Time-efficient (not 1-hour discussions)

**Key Stakeholders at Pfizer:**
- **Fred:** VP of Procurement (key internal stakeholder for Scope 3 reduction)
  - Engagement KPIs being developed for his team
  - Meeting scheduled in next few weeks
- **Elisa:** Colleague on sustainable sourcing team (works closely with Efthymios)
- **NetZero Champions:** Embedded in sourcing zones (good setup for DitchCarbon implementation)
- **Central Team:** Sustainable sourcing team (coordinates across organization)

**Pfizer's Goals:**
- -25% Scope 3 emissions reduction by 2030
- Engage top suppliers (focus on those not on track or without targets)
- Enable procurement teams to have meaningful conversations without being sustainability experts
- 5-year timeline (adequate - other companies reducing faster)

**Alex's Strategic Alignment:**
- "How can we disarm any excuses?" → Remove all barriers
- Provide free tools (no excuse: "I didn't know how to do it")
- Make expectations crystal clear ("Pfizer is telling you it's important")
- Adequate time provided (5 years is enough)

## Quotes & Memorable Moments

**On Career Transition:**
> "I'm kind of bored with procurement, so that's why I also shift my gears."

**On Survey Fatigue:**
> "This is what I'm trying to avoid. So I mean, there's, you know, what Alex said about, you know, leveraging this carbon and the one... So I don't want to say barely know, but it's not in their kind of area of interest, right? So they are discussing because mainly they just need to discuss it and because someone else ask them to do so."

**On Market Timing:**
> "Remember that we were discussing long ago that I want to introduce this but it's not the right time because we need to market it a bit better. So I think now it's the right time I think you know to start like sending to supplier."

**On Monetization Strategy:**
> "Give them something good, but don't give them too much. So I think this is too much... This is the first step, right? So we are kind of paying like extra thousand... So we are paying 8,000 to see this kind of stuff, right? So we are sending in a kind of interactive server to upgrade the way that we are questioning our suppliers and also to promote your job, right? So there is no need to be a masterpiece, but of course it needs to be something that can trigger."

**On Pharma Confidentiality:**
> "This is a very tricky question, you know, when you're talking about pharmaceuticals, it's it's not very easy, you know, to share supplier names and stuff like this."

**On Interactive Dashboard Value:**
> "So maybe it would be helpful for them and we can set it internally to their CPUs or anything. So, hey guys, this is how it looks. If based on the decision that we are planning to have, this would be our trajectory. And thanks to this carbon, you know."
