# Alex Rudnicki - Interaction Log

## Customer Call: Howden Contract Renewal - October 28, 2025

**Type:** Customer Call - Contract Renewal & Project Planning
**Customer:** Howden (Global Insurance Broker)
**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Attendees:** Alex Rudnicki, Varun Moka, Tim Rainbow (Sustainability Director), Ellen Daly-English (Sustainable Procurement)
**Duration:** ~28 minutes
**Purpose:** Contract renewal, carbon reporting roadmap, data integration planning

### Corporate Context & Transformation
- Howden transitioning to centralized corporate services division to globalize processes
- Currently federated: each global entity operates in isolation, but moving to standardized approach
- Includes data from: travel, procurement, property, facilities
- BW (subsidiary) currently separate entity, will financially align next year
- **Source-to-pay system project** underway with external consultants gathering spend data across all Howden entities

### Carbon Reporting Timeline & Assurance
**Key Deadline:** Mid to early March 2026 (public carbon data publication)
- **First limited assurance exercise** planned - unprecedented for Howden
- Process alignment with accounting/finance timelines
- Assurance kicks off early January with hard deadlines for data collection stages
- Auditor access: DitchCarbon provides platform access + exportable audit files with data sources and methodology
- **UL Assurance:** DitchCarbon methodology already assured by UL (leading global carbon assurer) - reduces auditor friction
- Data snapshot date: November 24th (end of business) for IT upload

**Data Collection Workflow:**
1. Consultants gather spend data (expected next week)
2. Ellen manipulates/formats data
3. Load into Salesforce Net Zero Cloud
4. Ready for assurance process (Jan-Mar)

### Supplier Spend Data Management
**Current State:**
- Top 2,000 suppliers already in platform
- Current threshold: ~£16,000 spend cutoff
- Expected threshold to remain similar with new source-to-pay data

**Strategy:**
- Keep submissions simple: focus on meaningful spend, bucket long tail suppliers by category
- DitchCarbon can handle 100% spend coverage while showing detail where needed
- Approach: top suppliers tracked individually, smaller suppliers grouped by category

**New Data Source:**
- Consultants pulling consolidated spend data from all Howden sources
- May reveal additional suppliers beyond current Unit 4 system
- Tim to confirm final spend threshold once consultant data reviewed

### Custom Filtering & Data Organization
- **Custom filter columns** available (up to 4 columns per project)
- Howden wants to map spend to: (1) pillars/entities, (2) procurement categories
- Benefits: category managers can see only their suppliers/categories without clutter
- Procurement moving toward global category managers - aligns well with this structure

### Salesforce Net Zero Cloud Integration
- Ellen's team selected emissions factors for most scopes
- **Purchase goods & services (PGS)** factors: awaiting DitchCarbon alignment
- Data transfer: DitchCarbon exports CSV → DitchCarbon pre-formats → Salesforce uploads
- **Pre-formatting effort:** ~1-2 hours from DitchCarbon side (handled by Alex)
- Snapshot date aligns with Compass IT team upload deadline (Nov 24th)

**Salesforce Administrator Coordination:**
- Howden has internal CRM team (3-4 people) managing Net Zero Cloud, Marketing Cloud, CRM
- They handle all development and data uploads
- Alex to be introduced and align on data objects/processes before integration starts
- Tim will connect DitchCarbon with admin team in ~1 week

**Currency/Technical Details:**
- Previous template required Euros (unusual for UK company)
- Ellen & Tim discussing with Kushboo/Compass team to switch to GBP
- Action: Confirm what currency/country codes needed for new process

### Contract Renewal & User Base
**Current Status:**
- Contract expires: Mid to late December
- Current users: ~10 (including BW team additions)
- Howden pays **below average** compared to other customers
- **Price increase plan:** Just inflation (not major increase) since they're "easy to work with"

**Variable Factors:**
- Third-party risk management team recently joined, may want access
- Tim meeting with them tomorrow to assess needs
- Currently expected: just reports/insights, not new system functionality
- Unlikely to drive major cost increases

**Next Steps:**
- Tim to confirm final user base after third-party risk mgmt discussion
- Alex to follow up in 1-2 weeks with renewal contract
- Standard support (auditing, Net Zero Cloud data load) already included in pricing
- Custom integrations would trigger different pricing

### Data Submission Timeline
**Key Dates:**
- **Week of Nov 10:** Ellen must submit data inputs to DitchCarbon (at least 2 weeks before IT deadline)
- **Nov 24:** Compass IT team uploads to Salesforce (final deadline)
- **Recommended buffer:** 2 weeks from Ellen to DitchCarbon ensures thorough processing
- Flexibility: Can prioritize faster turnaround (days) if needed based on supplier volume

**Reminders:**
- Alex will send reminder to Ellen if inputs not received within 2 weeks

### Key DitchCarbon Recommendations
1. **Unique IDs:** Provide any internal IDs (procurement system, Net Zero Cloud IDs) to track suppliers through multiple systems
2. **Emissions Factor Loading:** Let DitchCarbon handle formatting for Salesforce compatibility
3. **Template Columns:** Finalize what custom columns/filters needed early
4. **Contact Assignment:** Connect admin teams early to prevent integration surprises

### Key Learnings from Call
1. **Enterprise data complexity:** Howden's federated structure → multiple data sources (Unit 4 system, source-to-pay consultants, internal systems)
2. **Assurance importance:** Limited assurance is significant milestone; requires structured timeline, auditor access, clear methodology documentation
3. **Integration depth:** Not just DitchCarbon platform; full Salesforce ecosystem integration with internal admin coordination
4. **Threshold strategy:** Long-tail bucketing by category = practical approach for large supplier bases without losing coverage
5. **Relationship value:** Alex emphasized Howden gets favorable pricing because they're "easy to work with" - good customer relationship
6. **User growth uncertainty:** Even established customers may have unknown internal expansion needs (3rd party risk team)
