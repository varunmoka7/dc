# Alex Rudnicki - Interaction Log

## Customer Call: Howden Contract Renewal - October 28, 2025

**Type:** Customer Call - Contract Renewal & Project Planning
**Customer:** Howden (Global Insurance Broker)
**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Attendees:** Alex Rudnicki, Varun Moka, Tim Rainbow (Sustainability Director), Ellen Daly-English (Sustainable Procurement)
**Duration:** ~28 minutes
**Purpose:** Contract renewal, carbon reporting roadmap, data integration planning

### Corporate Context & Transformation
- Howden transitioning to centralized corporate services division to globalize processes
- Currently federated: each global entity operates in isolation, but moving to standardized approach
- Includes data from: travel, procurement, property, facilities
- BW (subsidiary) currently separate entity, will financially align next year
- **Source-to-pay system project** underway with external consultants gathering spend data across all Howden entities

### Carbon Reporting Timeline & Assurance
**Key Deadline:** Mid to early March 2026 (public carbon data publication)
- **First limited assurance exercise** planned - unprecedented for Howden
- Process alignment with accounting/finance timelines
- Assurance kicks off early January with hard deadlines for data collection stages
- Auditor access: DitchCarbon provides platform access + exportable audit files with data sources and methodology
- **UL Assurance:** DitchCarbon methodology already assured by UL (leading global carbon assurer) - reduces auditor friction
- Data snapshot date: November 24th (end of business) for IT upload

**Data Collection Workflow:**
1. Consultants gather spend data (expected next week)
2. Ellen manipulates/formats data
3. Load into Salesforce Net Zero Cloud
4. Ready for assurance process (Jan-Mar)

### Supplier Spend Data Management
**Current State:**
- Top 2,000 suppliers already in platform
- Current threshold: ~£16,000 spend cutoff
- Expected threshold to remain similar with new source-to-pay data

**Strategy:**
- Keep submissions simple: focus on meaningful spend, bucket long tail suppliers by category
- DitchCarbon can handle 100% spend coverage while showing detail where needed
- Approach: top suppliers tracked individually, smaller suppliers grouped by category

**New Data Source:**
- Consultants pulling consolidated spend data from all Howden sources
- May reveal additional suppliers beyond current Unit 4 system
- Tim to confirm final spend threshold once consultant data reviewed

### Custom Filtering & Data Organization
- **Custom filter columns** available (up to 4 columns per project)
- Howden wants to map spend to: (1) pillars/entities, (2) procurement categories
- Benefits: category managers can see only their suppliers/categories without clutter
- Procurement moving toward global category managers - aligns well with this structure

### Salesforce Net Zero Cloud Integration
- Ellen's team selected emissions factors for most scopes
- **Purchase goods & services (PGS)** factors: awaiting DitchCarbon alignment
- Data transfer: DitchCarbon exports CSV → DitchCarbon pre-formats → Salesforce uploads
- **Pre-formatting effort:** ~1-2 hours from DitchCarbon side (handled by Alex)
- Snapshot date aligns with Compass IT team upload deadline (Nov 24th)

**Salesforce Administrator Coordination:**
- Howden has internal CRM team (3-4 people) managing Net Zero Cloud, Marketing Cloud, CRM
- They handle all development and data uploads
- Alex to be introduced and align on data objects/processes before integration starts
- Tim will connect DitchCarbon with admin team in ~1 week

**Currency/Technical Details:**
- Previous template required Euros (unusual for UK company)
- Ellen & Tim discussing with Kushboo/Compass team to switch to GBP
- Action: Confirm what currency/country codes needed for new process

### Contract Renewal & User Base
**Current Status:**
- Contract expires: Mid to late December
- Current users: ~10 (including BW team additions)
- Howden pays **below average** compared to other customers
- **Price increase plan:** Just inflation (not major increase) since they're "easy to work with"

**Variable Factors:**
- Third-party risk management team recently joined, may want access
- Tim meeting with them tomorrow to assess needs
- Currently expected: just reports/insights, not new system functionality
- Unlikely to drive major cost increases

**Next Steps:**
- Tim to confirm final user base after third-party risk mgmt discussion
- Alex to follow up in 1-2 weeks with renewal contract
- Standard support (auditing, Net Zero Cloud data load) already included in pricing
- Custom integrations would trigger different pricing

### Data Submission Timeline
**Key Dates:**
- **Week of Nov 10:** Ellen must submit data inputs to DitchCarbon (at least 2 weeks before IT deadline)
- **Nov 24:** Compass IT team uploads to Salesforce (final deadline)
- **Recommended buffer:** 2 weeks from Ellen to DitchCarbon ensures thorough processing
- Flexibility: Can prioritize faster turnaround (days) if needed based on supplier volume

**Reminders:**
- Alex will send reminder to Ellen if inputs not received within 2 weeks

### Key DitchCarbon Recommendations
1. **Unique IDs:** Provide any internal IDs (procurement system, Net Zero Cloud IDs) to track suppliers through multiple systems
2. **Emissions Factor Loading:** Let DitchCarbon handle formatting for Salesforce compatibility
3. **Template Columns:** Finalize what custom columns/filters needed early
4. **Contact Assignment:** Connect admin teams early to prevent integration surprises

## 1:1 Call: Platform Deep Dive & Product Roadmap - October 29, 2025

**Type:** 1:1 Training Session - Platform & Product Strategy
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Duration:** ~32 minutes
**Topics:** Platform import challenges, product roadmap, sprint planning, organization matching system, self-serve enablement

### Context
- Varun experiencing laptop issues (old MacBook crashing frequently)
- New MacBook Air ordered October 29th, arriving Oct 31/Nov 1
- Varun struggling with platform import formatting despite tutorial videos from Daniel (via Veronika)
- Successfully uploaded simplified CSV with 30 organizations, but experiencing errors with complex imports

### Product Roadmap Overview (Miro Board)

**Access Granted:** Alex added Varun to DitchCarbon Miro product roadmap

**Sprint Structure:**
- **Two-week sprints** named after periodic table elements (Strontium → Yttrium → ...)
- Current sprint: Strontium (ending Friday)
- Next sprint: Yttrium
- Naming system: Cam's idea (simple, no need to think about names)

**Sprint Rhythm:**
1. **Monday (Week 1):** Sprint kickoff - discuss plans, assign tasks
2. **Throughout sprint:** Execute without roadmap changes (engineer focus)
3. **Friday (Week 2):** Sprint retrospective - review performance, learnings, decide weekend reprocessing needs

**Four Key Product Goals Framework:**

1. **Quality Data** (What should core data offering do?)
   - Accurate
   - Auditable (by user or their auditor)
   - Automated (only after accuracy & auditability established)

2. **Plug & Play Scope 3 Tool** (What should product do?)
   - Vision: Handle everything related to Scope 3
   - Current reality: Scope 3.1 and 3.2 (purchased goods/services focus)
   - Future: Expand to other Scope 3 categories
   - Focus on most important parts first

3. **Cash Flow Break Even** (How does it relate to business?)
   - Target: Break even in next quarter or so
   - Not chasing VC funding or $10B IPO
   - Everyone in company has ownership stake
   - Exit strategy: Acquisition by partner or profitable growth
   - "Default to live" philosophy

4. **Scalable Growth** (Business model efficiency)
   - Minimal advertising spend
   - Low overhead
   - Efficient growth mechanisms

### Q4 Priority Projects

**1. Platform Enablement (Organization Claims & Supplier Maturity)**
- Enable suppliers to claim their profiles
- Supplier maturity module in web app
- **Strategic shift:** SaaS tool → Platform

**2. Self-Serve Enablement (AI Agent Assistant)** ⭐ TOP PRIORITY
- **Problem:** Current import process requires handholding (Alex acknowledged Varun's confusion is valid)
- **Timeline:** Next two sprints (November)
- **Solution:** AI agent assisting users through import requests

**Planned Agent Capabilities:**
- Guide users through import flow ("Now you're doing this, you can skip if you want")
- Review inputs and identify mistakes ("You might want to change how you mapped this column")
- Proactive error detection ("I noticed an error driven by this problem - want me to fix it?")
- Auto-editing with user approval ("Click to approve edited inputs, then I'll import")
- **Goal:** Anyone can figure it out without training

**Why Agent vs. Perfect CSV Upload:**
- Not about making perfect CSV process
- About making ANY user successful without training
- Reduces manual support burden

### Organization Matching System Deep Dive

**Core Concept: Requested Organization vs. Matching Organization**

**Two-Record System:**
1. **Requested Organization:** What user asked for (their input)
2. **Matching Organization:** Official record from S&P Global database

**Why Separate?**
- User inputs don't always match official records
- Corporate hierarchies complicate matching
- Audit trail requirement (show what user requested vs. what data came from)

**Example Workflow (Apple):**
- User requests: "Apple Inc." with website, stock ticker, HQ region
- System resolves to: Official S&P Global "Apple Inc." record
- Shows full corporate tree with all subsidiaries

**Subsidiary Matching Example (Laser Like Inc.):**
- User requests: "Laser Like Inc." (subsidiary of Apple)
- Laser Like Inc. has no sustainability data
- System matches to: Apple Inc. (ultimate parent)
- Data flows down from parent to subsidiary
- **Frontend indication:** "Showing documents from Apple Inc." (even when viewing Laser Like Inc.)
- **Preference:** If subsidiary has data, show that. If not, climb tree until finding data.

**Matching Logic:**
- Request created → Status: "Located" (attempting match)
- System resolves organization
- Frontend displays requested org vs. matching org
- Corporate tree visible with all ownership relationships

### Corporate Hierarchy Intelligence

**S&P Global Database:**
- DitchCarbon pays for official corporate hierarchy data
- Tracks ownership relationships (parents, subsidiaries, full tree)
- Example: Apple owns Laser Like Inc. (system knows this even if user doesn't)

**Data Inheritance:**
- Subsidiary without data → inherits from parent
- Ultimate parent has data → flows to all subsidiaries
- Maintains audit trail of data source

### Fuzzy Matching vs. Direct Matching

**Direct Match (High Confidence):**
- User provides: DUNS number, LEI (Legal Entity Identifier), or other unique IDs
- Exact match to S&P Global record

**Fuzzy Match (Variable Confidence):**
- User provides: Name, website, HQ, name type (legal entity vs. trade name)
- **Current tool:** Kensho (S&P Global's fuzzy matching service)
- **Confidence threshold:** 75%+ = auto-match, <75% = manual review
- Better inputs = higher confidence scores

**Input Quality Impact:**
- Name only: Low confidence
- Name + website: Medium confidence
- Name + website + HQ + country code: High confidence
- Legal entity name flag: Highest accuracy

### Q4 Technical Project: In-House Matching System

**Current State Problems:**
- Database: ~1.4-1.5 million organizations
- Paying S&P Global for Kensho fuzzy matching
- Kensho sometimes cuts off service
- Accuracy could be better

**November Solution (Charlie's Project):**
1. **Scale database:** 1.5M → 10-20M organizations (proactively pull all S&P data)
2. **Replicate Kensho:** Build in-house fuzzy matching algorithm
3. **Benefits:**
   - Reduced costs (no Kensho fees)
   - Improved accuracy
   - No service interruptions
   - Full control over matching logic

**Impact:** Combined with AI agent assistant = dramatically better self-serve experience

### Waiting Tasks & Customer Prioritization

**"Waiting" Status Meaning:**
- System couldn't confidently resolve organization (<75% confidence)
- No research happening until user provides more input data
- Shows as "Action Required" flag on frontend

**Customer-Based Resolution Strategy:**

**High Priority Customers (e.g., Amazon Climate Pledge):**
- Manual review of ALL suppliers
- Create custom organization records if S&P doesn't have them
- Rationale: Amazon matters + Climate Pledge signatories likely disclose data
- Even small/Asian companies not in S&P → manually created
- Zero tolerance for "we don't know who this is"

**Lower Priority Customers (e.g., ETH Zurich):**
- 800-900 total suppliers
- ~100 remaining in "waiting" after initial auto-match
- GPT-assisted review for well-known companies (e.g., "American Express Europe" at 55% confidence)
- Manual match ~5 obvious ones out of 100
- Send remaining 95 back to customer: "Can you provide more inputs?"
- Final unresolved waiting tasks accepted (small businesses unlikely to have data)

**Prioritization Factors:**
1. Customer importance (Amazon vs. university)
2. Likelihood of data availability (large vs. small suppliers)
3. Quality of initial inputs provided
4. Effort vs. value tradeoff

### Multi-Round Resolution Process

**Round 1:** User uploads initial data
- Best-effort auto-matching (75%+ confidence)
- No pressure for perfect inputs

**Round 2:** DitchCarbon reviews waiting tasks
- Manual review of high-value suppliers
- GPT check for well-known companies
- Match obvious cases

**Round 3:** Request additional inputs from customer
- "Here are 100 we couldn't match - do you have more data?"
- Customer can provide: supplier emails (as website), tax IDs, other identifiers
- Re-run matching on additional inputs

**Final State:** Remaining waiting tasks
- Usually small businesses or bad input data
- S&P Global gaps (especially mid-size Asian companies)
- Accepted as unresolvable for lower-priority customers

**Customer Communication:**
- Transparent about what was matched (e.g., "800 resolved")
- Clear about what needs help (e.g., "100 remaining")
- Provide opportunity for additional inputs without pressure

### Regional Data Coverage Gaps

**S&P Global Strengths:**
- Best available aggregator of government portal data
- Good for medium-to-large companies globally
- Strong in UK, US, Europe

**S&P Global Weaknesses:**
- Small companies (inconsistent coverage)
- Asian markets (especially mid-size companies)
- Data freshness (can be out of date)
- Process quality varies by country

**Example:** India
- Government portals are primary source
- S&P aggregates from these portals
- But India process may not be as robust as UK process
- Regional-specific data providers might have better coverage (but S&P is still best aggregate)

### Frontend User Experience

**Successful Match Display:**
- Organization card shows matched company
- Data sources clearly attributed (e.g., "Documents from Apple Inc.")
- Corporate tree visible (parent/subsidiary relationships)

**Waiting Task Display:**
- Red "Action Required" flag
- Error message: "We couldn't resolve this company. Add more inputs to help us resolve it."
- Currently non-functional assistant prompt (asks for website but doesn't do much)
- **Future:** AI agent will actively help resolve

**Organization Details Page:**
- Requested organization name
- Matching organization name (if different)
- Full inputs provided by user
- History log (request created, resolution attempts, final match)
- Corporate tree visualization
- Data attribution (showing parent if using parent data)

### Bug Identified During Call

**Issue:** When viewing subsidiary with parent data, attribution not showing correctly
- Expected: "Showing documents from [Parent Company]" on all data tabs
- Current: Only showing on some views, missing on emissions tab
- Alex noted: Has bug ticket to fix this display issue

### Upcoming Meetings

**Mentioned:**
- Stand-up at 1pm UK time (daily rhythm)
- Coherent call later today (Varun invited, running late in his timezone)
- Varun to review Coherent notes beforehand

---

### Outstanding Action Items

**Alex Rudnicki:**

---

### Key Learnings from Call

**Technical Architecture:**
1. **Two-record system:** Critical for audit trail and data accuracy (requested vs. matching)
2. **Corporate hierarchy intelligence:** System knows ownership relationships even when users don't
3. **Confidence-based automation:** 75% threshold balances automation with accuracy
4. **Data inheritance:** Subsidiaries inherit parent data when they lack their own (with clear attribution)

**Product Strategy:**
5. **Self-serve is Q4 priority:** Current UX acknowledged as confusing; AI agent solution in development
6. **Quality before automation:** Accurate + Auditable first, then automate
7. **Platform transformation:** Moving from SaaS tool to platform (supplier claims, maturity module)
8. **Cash flow break even focus:** Not chasing VC funding, aiming for profitability Q1 2026

**Customer Success Approach:**
9. **Tiered effort model:** High-touch for strategic customers (Amazon), lower-touch for others (ETH Zurich)
10. **Multi-round resolution:** Don't demand perfect inputs upfront; iterate with customer
11. **Transparent communication:** Clear about what worked, what didn't, what needs help
12. **Effort vs. value:** Small supplier waiting tasks acceptable for lower-priority customers

**Data & Operations:**
13. **S&P Global best available:** Despite gaps, it's the best aggregate source
14. **Regional variations:** Process quality varies by country (UK > Asia for mid-size companies)
15. **Sprint discipline:** Two-week cycles with no roadmap changes mid-sprint (engineer focus)
16. **Naming simplicity:** Periodic table elements = no cognitive load on naming

**Personal Development:**
17. **Platform mastery ongoing:** Alex supportive of experimentation and learning
18. **Product context critical:** Understanding matching logic helps with customer conversations
19. **Customer prioritization:** Not all customers get same level of manual support (intentional strategy)

## Customer Call: Coherent - Q1 2026 Data Ingestion & Product Updates - October 30, 2025

**Type:** Customer Call - Data Processing & Feature Introduction
**Customer:** Coherent (Technology/Manufacturing)
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Duration:** ~30 minutes (hard stop at 30min mark)
**Attendees:** Alex Rudnicki, Veronika Yaneva, Varun Moka (DitchCarbon) | Richard Marino, Valerie Estacuy, Alexa (Coherent)
**Purpose:** Q1 2026 spend data review, product roadmap updates, team introductions

### Context & Relationship Status

**Partnership Duration:** ~1 year (since late 2024)
**Account Value:** £20,000 ACV
**Stage:** "In Love?" (High growth potential)
**Customer Pressure:** "Tremendous customer pressure" to reduce Scope 3 emissions fast

**New Developments:**
- New Chief Supply Chain Officer (very supportive of sustainability)
- Category manager enablement program underway
- Supplier engagement program launching (informational + action request letters)
- Presentation to Chief Supply Chain Officer scheduled (week of Nov 3)

### Team Introductions

**First Time Meeting Coherent:**
- Veronika Yaneva (3 months at DitchCarbon, from Emitwise, QA/operations)
- Varun Moka (Day 3 at DitchCarbon, Scope 3 research background, Berlin-based)

**Alex's Framing:** "Lucky to pick up Veronica when Emitwise went bust"

### Key Discussion Topics

#### 1. CDP Data Access Strategy

**Current State:**
- DitchCarbon has disclosure status + scores (purchased from CDP)
- Does NOT have full CDP database access (behind paywall)
- Proactively aggregates public CDP disclosures from supplier websites

**Negotiation Update:**
- In talks with CDP to purchase data outright
- Alex's assessment: "CDP becoming more and more difficult to work with"
- **Prediction:** "They are going to ask for a ridiculous amount of money for something we can mostly get ourselves for free"
- **Expected outcome:** Will NOT purchase from CDP

**Richard's Context (CDP History):**
- 2+ years ago: CDP disclosures were actually public (free)
- ~1.5 years ago: CDP put disclosures behind paywall
- Coherent looked at purchasing dataset years ago (too expensive)
- Alexa previously had to manually download/read ~100 CDP reports (painful)
- Coherent checks "willing to make public" with CDP but doesn't publish CDP download on website

**Workaround: Supplier Claim Profile Feature**
- Launched today (Oct 30)
- Suppliers claim their profile, see their scorecard, upload missing data (including CDP reports)
- Bypasses CDP paywall
- ~30 seconds for supplier to claim profile and upload
- DitchCarbon will proactively reach out to suppliers with CDP disclosure = TRUE but no data

**CDP Timeline (Richard's observation):**
- Submission: September
- Score release: January
- Data availability for buyers: Months earlier (supply chain members get access before scores published)

#### 2. Product Roadmap Updates

**Industry Emissions Factor Update:**
- Status: Scheduled but not yet live
- Timeline: Not expected before December 2025
- Behind other priorities (supplier claim profile, supplier maturity module)

**Supplier Maturity Module:**
- Status: In development
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks after supplier claim profile launch (early-mid November)
- Richard confirmed: "That was the other one I was thinking of"

#### 3. Q1 2026 Data Ingestion Planning

**Key Decisions Made:**

**A. Separate Project for Partial Year (Q1 2026)**
- Rationale: Avoid misleading absolute numbers in "Monitor" tab (partial vs. full year)
- Intensity metrics still useful
- Will merge into main project once full 2026 data available (end of year)

**B. Supplier Name Matching**
- Valerie confirmed: No changes to supplier names (using normalized names)
- Main spend suppliers "scrubbed and super clean"
- Might be 1-2 changes on tail end (acceptable)
- Q1 2026 names should match historical → if not, likely new suppliers

**C. Consolidation Threshold: £10,000 (Consistent)**
- Apply same logic as historical data (BU + L2 level)
- Even for partial year (Q1 2026)
- Rationale: Simplicity - "one rule, never have to think about it"
- Result: Thousands of suppliers → manageable view with "Other Expenses" rows

**D. End-of-Year Merge Strategy (Future Planning)**
- **Option A (Foolproof):** Coherent provides one file with all years (2023-2026)
  - DitchCarbon overwrites entire project
  - Zero risk of duplicates
- **Option B (Matching):** Coherent provides only 2026 data, DitchCarbon matches to existing rows
  - Risk: Slight formatting differences → duplicate rows
  - DitchCarbon will flag ambiguous cases
- **Decision:** Don't need to decide until close to end of year

**E. Quarterly Data Submission (Q2, Q3, Q4)**
- **Option A:** Combined file (Q1+Q2, then Q1+Q2+Q3, etc.) - easier for DitchCarbon
- **Option B:** Separate quarterly files - DitchCarbon will map back
- Flexible approach: Whatever's easier for Coherent

**Timeline:**
- Review file size, do first run
- **If smooth sailing:** ~1 week
- **If questions arise:** Could push timeline out
- Will notify Valerie if complexity arises

#### 4. Supplier Engagement Strategy

**Current Phase: Internal Enablement**
- Training sessions completed for category managers on DitchCarbon platform
- Category managers learning to:
  - Access supplier disclosure status
  - Understand supplier targets
  - Identify non-disclosing suppliers
- Presentation to new Chief Supply Chain Officer next week (Nov 3)
  - Topics: Supplier disclosure rates, data access, engagement strategy
  - Tone: "Extremely optimistic" - Chief Supply Chain Officer "very supportive"

**Planned Supplier Outreach:**

1. **Informational Letter:** "This is going to be expected"
2. **Action Request Letter:** "You need to disclose or provide Coherent with information"
   - Start thinking about reduction plan
   - Set targets
   - Explain actions to meet targets

**Data Collection Tool Decision (Pending):**

**Option A: Microsoft Excel Sheet (Alexa's creation)**
- Custom tracking spreadsheet
- Manual data entry
- Requires reconciliation with DitchCarbon

**Option B: DitchCarbon Supplier Claim Profile (NEW - launched today)**
- Supplier claims profile directly on platform
- Sees scorecard, emissions data, recommendations (FREE)
- Uploads missing data
- DitchCarbon QA processes → visible to Coherent
- **Key value-add:** Suppliers get emissions reduction recommendations (case studies from peer companies)

**Valerie's Response:** "I think it would be great to explore that"
- **Preference indicated:** "The more we can do with the tool and have just one source of truth and one process, that's great"

**Alex's Commitment:**
- Send demo video later today (Oct 30)
- Show how supplier would use claim profile
- Provide access links when Coherent ready

### Supplier Recommendations Feature (Alex's Pitch)

**What It Is:**
- DitchCarbon generates reduction recommendations based on peer companies already reducing
- Case studies from similar companies
- Actionable guidance: "Here's what you should do to improve"

**Supplier Value Proposition:**
- Suppliers see their scorecard (FREE)
- Get actionable recommendations (FREE)
- Understand customer expectations
- Not just data request → they get value from engagement

**Coherent Benefit:**
- Suppliers more likely to engage (getting value, not just asked for data)
- One source of truth (no Excel reconciliation)
- Automated data ingestion

**Alex's Framing:** "Can we make that something where... it could just be like, hey, we'd like you to improve. Check out what DitchCarbon would tell you to do to improve. Here's the link. And it's kind of that simple."

### Richard's Closing Context

**Current Phase:** "In a lull"
- Not peak reporting season
- Focus: Routine updates, process optimization ("running like a well-oiled machine")
- "Things will really start heating up as we get into next year's reporting cycle"

**Valerie's Focus:**
- "Working furiously to engage with suppliers to push for emissions reduction"
- Baseline data established → now pushing for actual reductions
- **Challenge:** "Whether we're trending in the right direction fast enough"

**Customer Pressure:**
- "Under a tremendous amount of customer pressure to get Scope 3 emissions down pretty fast"

**DitchCarbon's Role:**
- Measure aggregate progress
- Track trending direction
- "See in aggregate whether we're trending in the right direction"

**Relationship Tone:**
- "Welcome to Veronica and Mocha. Glad to have you on the team."
- "It's been a good partnership so far."

### Outstanding Action Items

**Veronika Yaneva:**
- [ ] Support QA for Q1 2026 data ingestion

### Key Learnings from Call

**Product-Market Fit:**
1. **Supplier claim profile timing perfect:** Launched exactly when Coherent evaluating supplier engagement tools
2. **Recommendations as engagement tool:** Suppliers more likely to engage if they get value (not just data request)
3. **One source of truth preferred:** Valerie's enthusiasm for platform-native solution vs. Excel reconciliation

**Customer Success Patterns:**
4. **Phased supplier engagement:** Internal enablement first (category managers, executives), then external outreach
5. **Leadership support critical:** New Chief Supply Chain Officer = program accelerator
6. **Customer pressure drives urgency:** "Tremendous pressure" → need to demonstrate progress "fast enough"

**Data Management:**
7. **Partial year handling:** Separate projects avoid misleading comparisons (absolute numbers)
8. **Consistent threshold = simplicity:** £10k rule for all submissions (never rethink)
9. **Flexible data submission:** Combined or separate quarterly files - whatever's easier for customer

**Relationship Dynamics:**
10. **Collaborative decision-making:** "What's easier for you?" approach (customer-centric)
11. **Transparency builds trust:** Open about CDP challenges ("ridiculous amount of money")
12. **Realistic expectations:** "1 week if smooth sailing" sets appropriate timeline

**CDP Strategy:**
13. **Paywall too expensive:** CDP data purchase unlikely (Alex's prediction)
14. **Supplier claim profile bypasses paywall:** Direct supplier upload = coverage without CDP cost
15. **Proactive aggregation sufficient:** Public disclosures + supplier self-service = adequate coverage

### Relationship Health Indicators

**Positive Signals:**
- "It's been a good partnership so far" (Richard)
- "Extremely optimistic" about Chief Supply Chain Officer support (Valerie)
- "The more we can do with the tool and have just one source of truth" (Valerie)
- Growing program: Category managers, executive presentation, supplier engagement
- "In Love?" stage validated: High engagement, strategic alignment

**Expansion Potential:**
- Category manager adoption increasing
- Chief Supply Chain Officer support growing
- Supplier engagement program launching (scales platform usage)
- Potential for additional users as program expands

## 1:1 Meeting: SAP Deliverable Deep Dive & Platform Demo - October 30, 2025

**Type:** 1:1 Training Session - Customer Deliverables & Platform Navigation
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Duration:** ~42 minutes
**Topics:** SAP deliverable workflow, supplier segmentation, claim profile feature, assurance tracking, data extraction process, knowledge graph discussion, team meetups

### Opening Context

**Personal Updates:**
- Varun received new laptop (MacBook) after 8 years (previous: MacBook 2015)
- German keyboard layout (learning to adapt)
- Alex's laptop story: Bought high-end MacBook Pro between jobs to play Harry Potter Hogwarts Legacy game

**Alex's Day Yesterday (Oct 29):**
- Working on non-standard customer deliverable for SAP
- SAP: Biggest German tech company, DitchCarbon customer
- Always time-consuming when delivering non-standard work

### SAP Deliverable Workflow Overview

**File Organization Philosophy:**
- **Google Drive structure:** Sales and Marketing → Customers → [Customer Folder]
- Every customer/prospect has dedicated folder
- Working files (spreadsheets, deliverables) live in Google Drive, not Notion
- Notion: Conversation notes only
- Google Drive: Files, deliverables, spreadsheets

**SAP Folder Structure:**
- Example: "2025 October Deliverable" (mislabeled as 2024)
- Contains: Multiple sheets, calculations, segmentation logic

### SAP's Supplier Segmentation Strategy

**Goal:** Segment top 300 suppliers and provide clear next steps for each

**Segmentation Rules:**
1. **Not Disclosing** → Next step: Request disclosure
   - Use claim profile link for supplier to claim profile
   - Example: Blackline Holdings → here's the claim link

2. **Disclosing but Missing Categories** → Next step: Request missing categories
   - Show which upstream Scope 3 categories are missing
   - Everyone discloses Scope 1+2 (mandatory baseline)
   - Upstream Scope 3 is where gaps exist
   - Can use claim profile link to request missing data
   - ~1-2 minute process for supplier

3. **Disclosing All Relevant Categories** → Check if emission factor exists
   - If NO emission factor → missing revenue data
   - Next step: Request revenue
   - Emission factor = (Scope 1 + Scope 2 + Upstream Scope 3) / Revenue
   - Always in **kg CO2e per dollar spent**
   - Denominator missing = no emission factor

4. **Has Emission Factor but No Assurance** → Request assurance
   - Two types: Limited assurance or Reasonable assurance
   - Examples:
     - Oracle: Got "verified" but didn't specify level → unspecified assurance
     - Microsoft: Limited assurance from Deloitte (documented)
   - Next step: Ask supplier to get limited/reasonable assurance or clarify existing assurance

**Key Insight:** Downstream Scope 3 NOT included in emission factors

**Why Exclude Downstream?**
- **Downstream = Use of sold products** (customer's usage of your product)
- Example: Google Ads / GCP usage
  - Downstream = electricity used by SAP when using Google services
  - But SAP already calculates that electricity in their own Scope 2
  - Including downstream = **double counting**
- Downstream often = customer's Scope 1 or Scope 2
- DitchCarbon calculates: **Scope 1 + Scope 2 + Upstream Scope 3 only**

### Platform Data Export & Structure

**Export Files (Spreadsheet View):**
- Click export button → download all data in spreadsheet form
- Same data as web app, just in CSV/Excel format
- Example: Oracle data export

**Key Data Points:**
- **Total Upstream Emission Factor** (most important)
  - Scope 1 + 2 + Upstream Scope 3 / Revenue
  - Units: kg CO2e per dollar spent
  - Allows calculation: SAP emissions = Spend × Emission Factor
- **Document Source:**
  - Original document URL (from company website)
  - Backup on DitchCarbon servers (in case original moves)
- **Category Breakdown:**
  - All 15 Scope 3 categories shown separately
  - Upstream vs. Downstream clearly marked
- **Assurance Fields:**
  - Assurance level (Limited, Reasonable, Unspecified, None)
  - Auditor name (e.g., Deloitte, PwC, KPMG)
  - Text excerpt from document

### Document-Level Assurance Tracking

**Backend System (Admin View):**
- Each document has own assurance level
- Companies can have multiple documents per year (sometimes 2+ documents for same year)
- Example: Air Liquid
  - 2024: One main document (producing most information)
  - 2023: Two documents
  - Each document independently tracked

**Data Extraction:**
- **Robot-extracted data:** No human entry icon
- **Human-verified data:** Human icon visible (QA team reviewed)
- Process: Robot always tries first → if flagged as potentially wrong → human fixes

**Assurance Details Per Document:**
- **Assurance level:** Limited, Reasonable, None
- **Assurance text:** Exact excerpt from document
- **Auditor:** Extracted from document (e.g., "Statutory auditors" → PwC, KPMG)
- Example: Air Liquid
  - 400-page document
  - Assurance info on 2 pages
  - Robot extracted key information accurately

**Corporate Hierarchy & Document Ownership:**
- Air Liquid (France-based)
- Owns 44 documents currently
- 4 documents "processing" (stuck status - engineering issue)
- Documents from different years (2023, 2022, 2021...)
- Documents from different regions (global, France-specific, India-specific)

**Document Processing Lifecycle:**
- Status: Created → [~25 steps] → Synced (done)
- Sometimes documents get stuck in "Created" status
- Engineering team working on finding root causes of stuck documents

### Frontend User Experience (Web App)

**Organization Profile View:**
- Company name (e.g., Air Liquid)
- Corporate initiatives (CDP, SBTi, etc.)
- Revenue (pulled from S&P Global)
- Corporate hierarchy (all subsidiaries/parents)

**Data Display:**
- Documents used for each year
- Assurance status per document
- Same fields as export (displayed for user)
- Target tracking (pulled from documents)

**Backend Editability:**
- All data changeable on backend if incorrect
- Updates flow to web app and export files

### Document Processing Issues (Engineering Challenge)

**Current Problem:**
- Documents sometimes get stuck in processing
- 25-step research/extraction process
- When document changes → organization profile may change
- Logic determines: Is new document more relevant than old document?
- System should auto-update

**Example Issue:**
- Air Liquid: 4 documents stuck in "Created" status for 1-2 weeks
- Expected: Should move through process to "Synced"
- Engineering focus: Find root causes, prevent stuckness

**Varun's Suggestion:**
- Convert PDF to machine-readable format for simpler extraction
- Take snapshots

**Alex's Response:**
- Already extracting text (not doing OCR unless text extraction fails)
- Machine-readable format already in use

### Deep Dive: OCR & Document Processing (Varun's Knowledge Graph Project)

**Varun's Research:**
- **DeepSeek OCR** (new model): Much greater capacity for image extraction
- Use case: Knowledge graph creation
- Challenge: Extraction process difficult, missing tables/data
- **Cost barrier:** $15,000 + Nvidia GPU required

**Alex's Response:**
- Good conversation topic for dev team
- "Hey, when I was doing my side project, I was looking into this - have you thought about it?"
- Could be useful suggestion

**Current DitchCarbon Tools:**
- **URL Box:** Converts HTML webpage → PDF
- **Other tool:** Image capture (similar to DeepSeek OCR concept)
- Alex: "I think it can be improved. Share your suggestions."

### Knowledge Graph Discussion (Varun's Project)

**Varun's Idea:**
- Use **knowledge graph on HyperRegister** instead of vector databases
- Easier to create semantic relationships
- Better for tracking connections
- Can explain with example later

**Alex's Response:**
- "You should have a 1:1 with Charlie next week"
- **Charlie Groves:** Primary platform engineer
  - Focus: Research platform (supplier name → full profile)
  - Most knowledgeable on team about research process
  - Works closely with Gourav on implementation
  - Alex and Charlie co-design research platform features

**Meeting Guidelines:**
- **No Meeting Thursdays:** Dev team finishes sprint work
- Schedule 1:1 for different day

### Team Culture & Contribution Philosophy

**Alex's Perspective:**
- Varun: Not a developer, but has technical awareness
- **Why hired:** Can navigate when system not working, identify bugs, make improvement suggestions
- Role: Customer delivery today + observe what's not working + suggest improvements

**Contribution Model:**
- Work on customer deliverables (helping today)
- Observe system limitations
- Make technical suggestions to dev team
- Navigate platform quirks due to technical understanding

**Value Proposition:**
- "You'll be able to navigate when our system is not working the way we expect it to"
- "You'll be able to understand: this feels like there's a bug here"

### Side Project & Company Alignment Discussion

**Context:**
- Varun has ongoing side project (knowledge graph, emissions-related)
- Alex: Okay to work on while employed, BUT...

**Alex's Expectation:**
- Clear priority: Working for DitchCarbon business
- "I actually hope your best ideas... you see it as like, you want to help build our business"
- "In many ways they are the same thing or they're similar"

**Best Case Scenario (Alex's Vision):**
1. Varun proves valuable member of core team
2. DitchCarbon offers **ownership stake** (stock options)
   - Charlie has options
   - Every core member gets some ownership
3. Full alignment: "Grow this business and keep building"
4. Good ideas from side project → make it happen faster with team + funding + customers

**Alex's Pitch:**
- "If that's your goal as well, then any kind of good ideas you had for what you were working on before, you now have a team that can help make it happen much faster"
- "We haven't raised a lot of money, but we've raised some money. And yes, we already have big customers."
- "Anything you want to have happen, if it's a good idea, we'll take the good idea and make it happen faster and bigger."

**Varun's Response:**
- "I have the same mindset as well. Nothing different actually."
- "That kind of helps me a lot to achieve the target faster."
- "Even if I have to get some value in the company, I have to earn it. Not just like, you know, it's just..."

**Standard Process:**
- **6-month trial period** for everyone
  - Alex + Mark: 6 months before co-founders
  - Cam: Same
  - Charlie: 1-year internship before full-time (still a student)
- Feel out working relationship
- If good fit after 6 months → discuss equity/options

**Charlie Context:**
- Still a student
- Sits in AI classes: "I know why the professor who is talking about AI is wrong" (Alex's humor)
- Works full-time while studying

**Alex's Philosophy:**
- "I hope that you basically take all the energy, time, ideas, make it part of our business"
- "Make your stamp on the business because we can grow it a lot faster"
- "We have people like you that really want to do this. This is your passion."
- "Main reason I wanted to hire you: I can see that you have demonstrated that this is your passion"
- "Everyone on the team, we want them to feel like this is the most important work that they can do for the next 10 years and build a big business doing that"

### Team Meetup Planning (UK/EU)

**Alex's Question:** "Would you like to meet with some of the team in the UK?"

**Varun's Response:** "Going to UK is my dream."

**Challenges:**
- Brexit visa complications
- Alternative: Team meetup in EU (if UK visa inconvenient)

**Current Team Locations:**
- Marcello: EU
- Veronika: EU
- Mark: UK
- Alex: US

**Timing Options:**

**Option A: Sooner UK Visit (Onboarding-focused)**
- Mark's suggestion: Come to UK
- 3-4 days (short trip)
- Meet core UK-based team
- Likely tourist visa sufficient

**Option B: January Conference (Scope 3 Peer Group)**
- Annual conference Alex attends
- **Location:** London (January 2026)
- **Conference:** Scope 3 Peer Group
  - Biggest companies decarbonizing supply chains
  - DitchCarbon closely connected with group
- Alex definitely attending
- Could coordinate Marcello/Veronika attendance
- **Varun's LinkedIn connection:** Ollie (conference organizer)
  - Ollie = close friend of Mark's
  - Ollie = advisor to DitchCarbon
  - Varun had LinkedIn conversations with Ollie previously

**Action Items:**
- Varun: Look into UK visa requirements (3-4 days, tourist visa)
- Alex: Talk with Mark about timing/logistics
- Next discussion: Varun has visa context ready

### Varun's Question: Pfizer KPI Work

**Context:**
- Varun saw Alex working on Pfizer KPIs
- Wanted to help: Look into competitor sustainability reports, research

**Alex's Update:**
- Pfizer still figuring out internal plan
- Recent call with #2 sustainability person
- Trying to decide: What targets to set for procurement team?
- Goal: Align internal procurement KPIs with external Scope 3 absolute reduction target (by 2030)

**Two Target Type Options:**

**Option A: Reduction Goal (Hard to Measure)**
- "Reduce X% by Y date"
- Difficult for procurement teams to track

**Option B: Engagement Target (Currently Leaning)**
- Top 120 suppliers identified
- Segment: Not on track to hit targets, haven't set targets
- KPI: Talk with each supplier, show them data, ask for their plan, report back
- "Your KPI is you need to talk with all 10 of them and get their response"
- More achievable, measurable

**Timeline:**
- First 2 years: Engagement KPIs
- Track reduction out to 2030 (longer-term metric)

**Central Team Role:**
- Work with key procurement teams
- Provide: Here are your top 10 suppliers
- KPI tracking: Did you engage? What was response?

**Alex's Guidance:**
- DitchCarbon currently in advisory role
- "Just advisors for them to help them think what's possible"
- Will work on deliverables later (not now)

**Varun's Interest:**
- Reviewed Pfizer notes (found very interesting)
- Wants to research independently
- Will send materials if finds something useful

**Alex's Response:** "Sure, sure. Sounds good."

### Administrative: Payroll & Invoicing

**Invoice Submission:**
- **Timing:** Last week of every month (for upcoming month)
- **This month:** Prorate for 5 work days (Oct 27-31)
- **Send to:** finance@ditchcarbon.com
- **Payment day:** Last Friday of every month
- **Tomorrow (Oct 31):** Running payroll
- Okay to submit late (will pay ASAP), but preferred before last Friday for convenience

**Laptop Expense:**
- Submit via **Xero** (expense submission)
- Separate from invoice (expenses ≠ invoice)

**Varun's Action:**
- Invoice for laptop + payroll (initially confused)
- Alex clarified: Invoice = payroll, Xero = expenses

**Alex's Follow-Up:**
- Will send invoice template as reference

### Expense Submission Follow-Up - October 30, 2025

**Channel:** Slack (asynchronous)
**Context:** Varun flagged missing Xero expense account and banking details confirmation while submitting laptop reimbursement.

**Conversation Highlights:**
- Varun noted no `Computer Hardware` expense account available in Xero and asked Alex to add it.
- Varun also asked whether Alex already had his bank/account details on file.
- Alex confirmed he does not have Varun's bank details and advised sending them to `finance@ditchcarbon.com` (finance/bookkeepers can assist if Xero setup unclear).
- Alex recommended emailing the finance alias to confirm which account to use for the laptop expense in Xero.

**Outcome:** Finance team now the point of contact for adding bank details and clarifying the correct expense account; Varun to follow up directly with finance if needed.

### Upcoming: Pfizer Call

**Timing:** Later today (Oct 30)
**Nature:** Casual call with working-level employees (not VP)
**Expected Topic:** Claim profiles - how to use them
**Alex:** Will invite Varun to shadow

### Key Learnings from Call

**Customer Delivery Workflow:**
1. **File organization matters:** Google Drive for files, Notion for notes (clear separation)
2. **Segmentation = clarity:** SAP wants clear rules + clear next steps (no ambiguity)
3. **Claim profile = solution:** Makes supplier engagement simple (1-2 minutes for supplier)
4. **Assurance levels critical:** Limited vs. Reasonable vs. Unspecified = different audit confidence

**Technical Architecture:**
5. **Downstream exclusion justified:** Prevents double-counting (customer's Scope 1/2 already calculated)
6. **Document-level tracking:** Each document independently assured and processed
7. **Robot + human QA:** Automation first, human verification when flagged
8. **Processing pipeline complexity:** 25 steps from "Created" → "Synced" (challenges exist)

**Platform Product Strategy:**
9. **Export flexibility:** Users can download all data in spreadsheet form (not locked in web app)
10. **Backend editability:** All data correctable if extraction errors occur
11. **Corporate hierarchy intelligence:** System tracks all subsidiaries/parents automatically
12. **Multiple documents per year:** Some companies disclose globally + regionally (all tracked)

**Team Culture & Growth:**
13. **6-month trial standard:** Alex, Mark, Cam, Charlie all went through same process
14. **Ownership for core members:** Stock options offered to proven contributors
15. **Technical awareness valued:** Don't need to be developer, but need to spot bugs and suggest improvements
16. **Passion = hiring criteria:** Alex hired Varun because demonstrated passion for this work
17. **10-year vision:** "Most important work for next 10 years" = team alignment expectation

**Personal Development:**
18. **Side projects okay, but...:** Expectation is best ideas go to DitchCarbon (aligned incentives)
19. **Team makes ideas bigger/faster:** Solo project < Team + funding + customers
20. **Earn equity, don't expect it:** 6 months to prove value → then ownership discussions

**Team Coordination:**
21. **No Meeting Thursdays:** Protect dev team sprint completion time
22. **Cross-functional learning:** Varun should talk to Charlie (platform expert) about knowledge graphs
23. **Conference networking:** Scope 3 Peer Group (Ollie) = strategic relationship (advisor)

**Operational Details:**
24. **Payroll rhythm:** Last Friday of month, invoice due last week of month
25. **Expense separation:** Xero for expenses, email invoice for payroll
26. **Customer advisory vs. execution:** Sometimes DitchCarbon just helps customer think (not deliverable yet)

**Data Quality & Compliance:**
27. **Greenhouse gas protocol rigor:** DitchCarbon rejects non-standard disclosures (e.g., Google combining categories)
28. **Emission factor formula:** (Scope 1 + 2 + Upstream Scope 3) / Revenue = kg CO2e per dollar
29. **Assurance text extraction:** Exact excerpts from 400-page documents (robot accurate)
30. **Source attribution:** Always show original document + DitchCarbon backup (transparency)

**Engineering Challenges:**
31. **Stuck documents:** Known issue, engineering actively working on root cause
32. **OCR improvement opportunity:** DeepSeek OCR suggestion = valid (expensive but potentially valuable)
33. **Knowledge graph potential:** Varun's expertise could improve semantic relationship tracking

## Customer Call: Pfizer - Product Feature Demo & Supplier Engagement Strategy - October 30, 2025

**Type:** Customer Call - Product Features & Interactive Dashboard Planning
**Customer:** Pfizer (Global Pharmaceutical)
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Time:** 3pm Berlin time
**Duration:** ~45 minutes
**Attendees:** Alex Rudnicki, Varun Moka (DitchCarbon) | Efthymios (Sustainable Sourcing), Elisa (mentioned, not present)
**Purpose:** Demonstrate claim profile feature, discuss interactive forecast dashboard, plan supplier engagement approach

### Context & Relationship

**Pfizer Contact: Efthymios**
- **Role:** Sustainable Sourcing
- **Background:** Previously in compliance and procurement (couple of years), studied finance
- **Current Focus:** Scope 3 supplier engagement (shifting away from traditional procurement)
- **Communication Style:** Strategic, product-oriented, focused on simplicity and avoiding bureaucratic surveys
- **Key Insight:** "I'm kind of bored with procurement, so that's why I also shift my gears"
- **Current Challenge:** Most exciting jobs at Pfizer now

**Relationship with DitchCarbon:**
- Knows DitchCarbon best out of anyone at Pfizer
- "Great partner" helping with implementation work
- Key point of contact for procurement emissions work
- Working with Fred (VP of Procurement) - key internal stakeholder for Scope 3 reduction

**Varun's Introduction:**
- Third day at DitchCarbon
- Specifically asked Alex to join Pfizer call (very interested)
- Had been reading notes beforehand
- First customer call with Pfizer specifically

### Strategic Context: Pfizer's Supplier Engagement Philosophy

**Problem to Avoid:**
- **Survey fatigue:** Long 1-hour calls between procurement/account managers discussing sustainability topics outside their expertise
- People discussing "because someone else asked them to do so" (not genuine engagement)
- Bureaucratic checkbox exercises without meaningful outcomes

**Desired Approach:**
- Simple, actionable, non-bureaucratic
- Enable conversations without requiring deep sustainability expertise
- Provide value to suppliers (not just data extraction)
- Time-efficient (not 1-hour discussions)

**Alex's Alignment:**
- "How can we disarm any excuses?" → Remove barriers for suppliers
- Provide free tools so suppliers have no excuse ("I didn't know how to do it")
- Make Pfizer's expectations crystal clear ("Pfizer is telling you it's important")
- Adequate timeline (5 years is enough - other companies are reducing faster than needed for Pfizer's goals)

**Efthymios' Vision:**
- Introduce DitchCarbon's supplier claim profile feature
- Let suppliers see their trajectory, understand expectations, provide responses
- Avoid endless meetings and surveys
- **Market timing:** Not ready previously, but "now it's the right time"

### Key Discussion Topics

#### 1. Supplier Claim Profile Feature (Launched Oct 30)

**How It Works:**

**Step 1: Dashboard Data Export**
- Click "dashboard data export" button
- New column appears: "Public Page" (URL for each supplier)

**Step 2: Supplier Claims Profile**
- Pfizer shares link with supplier (e.g., Publicis)
- Supplier clicks "Claim" button
- System verifies email domain matches company (e.g., publicis.com)
- Creates account or logs into existing account
- Claims profile (Alex live-demoed but team member had just removed feature from view)

**Step 3: Supplier's View ("My Organization" Tab)**
- NEW TAB: "My Organization" (shows only their company, not others)
- Sees exact same view that Pfizer sees when clicking on that supplier:
  - **Forecast trajectory**
  - **Recommendations** (DitchCarbon's suggestions for reduction)
  - **Scorecard** (how Pfizer evaluates them)
  - **All tabs** that customer sees

**Step 4: Data Upload**
- Additional tab: "Upload Data"
- Supplier submits data directly to DitchCarbon
- Options:
  - **Private** (just for Pfizer)
  - **Public** (available to any company viewing their profile)
- No more file passing through email/manual uploads

**Value Proposition for Pfizer:**
- Eliminates manual file transfer
- Suppliers understand expectations clearly
- Suppliers can self-serve
- Simple communication: "Here's the link for your company. Go ahead and claim it."

#### 2. Interactive Forecast Dashboard (Efthymios' Big Idea)

**Current Forecast Display:**
- **Red dotted line:** Supplier's committed target (from SBTi, CDP, etc.)
- **Gold line:** 2-year historical trend
- **Purple line:** 5-year historical trend
- **Insight:** Recently supplier improved, so 2-year trend (gold) shows closer alignment to target than 5-year (purple)

**Efthymios' Vision: Make It Interactive with Questionnaires**

**Concept:**
1. Supplier sees their current trajectory based on publicly disclosed data
2. Below forecast graph: **3-4 short questions** (not long surveys)
3. Questions connect to **preset percentage changes** in forecast lines
4. As supplier selects responses, **forecast line adjusts in real-time**
5. Supplier sees "new trajectory" based on their planned decisions
6. Can export/screenshot to share internally with leadership

**Example Questions:**
- "Based on current data, this is your trajectory. Do you think this is realistic?"
- "Are you planning major capex/investments in upcoming years?"
  - If YES → forecast line goes UP (e.g., +10% emissions)
- "Are you planning to withdraw from your commitments?"
  - If YES → forecast shifts to less optimistic scenario
- "Are you planning major emissions reduction investments?"
  - If YES → forecast line goes DOWN

**Additional Features:**
- **Comment box** below each question (supplier can add context)
- **Attachment option** (supplier can upload supporting documents)
- Result: "Based on your responses, this would be your new trajectory"

**Supplier Value Proposition:**
- Many suppliers may not have **visualized their own trajectory**
- Can use tool internally to show leadership: "Here's what our path looks like based on our decisions"
- "Thanks to DitchCarbon" (brand value for DitchCarbon)
- Helps suppliers think through implications of their plans

**Pfizer Value Proposition:**
- Suppliers provide **forward-looking information** (not just historical data)
- Pfizer sees supplier's future plans and investment intentions
- Segmentation becomes more predictive (not just backward-looking)
- Reduces need for manual outreach/surveys

**Alex's Response:**
- "Totally doable"
- Timeline: **By end of year** (pretty realistic)
- Questions alone (without interactive graph adjustment) = sooner
- Full interactivity = more complex but achievable

**Technical Considerations:**

**Challenge: How to Let Suppliers Change Forecast**
- Current forecast = calculated from historical trends + targets
- Supplier input needed: "What is your carbon rate of change?"
- **Scope 1/2:** Suppliers likely CAN estimate future trajectory (they control operations)
- **Scope 3:** Much harder to quantify
- Alex: "If I ask you, what is Pfizer's change in carbon intensity going to be for Scope 1 next year... could you tell me?"
- Efthymios: "Maybe... I know where we want to go (e.g., -25% reduction by 2030), but I cannot tell you about intensity"

**Easiest Implementation (Alex's suggestion):**
1. **Preset questions** with supplier responses (visible to Pfizer)
2. Supplier can **comment** on forecast: "Do you think this is realistic?"
3. Display supplier's response on profile view for anyone viewing it
   - E.g., "Supplier thinks forecast may be optimistic because they plan heavier capex than previous years"
4. **Scope 1/2 trajectory editing** (suppliers more likely to have this data)
5. Sectoral/regional benchmarks as fallback lines (not just supplier-specific targets)

**Future Feature: Sectoral Benchmark Comparison**

**Current Forecast Sources:**
- Supplier's committed target
- Supplier's historical trend (2-year and 5-year)

**Potential Addition: Industry/Regional Expected Trajectory**
- Not based on supplier target, but on **sector decarbonization expectations**
- Example: "Pharmaceutical manufacturers in India expected to decarbonize at X% rate"
- Based on:
  - % of emissions from electricity × Indian grid decarbonization rate
  - Key material regulations
  - Regional commitments (e.g., India 2070 net zero, China 2060, Germany 2050)
  - Industry-specific goals (e.g., aviation, maritime shipping = "roughly 2050")

**DitchCarbon Already Has This Data:**
- Used in "Forecasting" module (for entire Pfizer project)
- Could plot as additional line on supplier-level forecasts
- Shows supplier: "Here's what peers in your sector/region are expected to do"

**Varun's Suggestion: Peer Comparison in Same Graph**
- Show supplier's data alongside peer data (suppliers in same niche/region)
- Help suppliers benchmark themselves

**Efthymios' Response:**
- "This is a very tricky question in pharmaceuticals" (supplier name confidentiality issues)
- Better to use **sectoral/regional commitments** than showing other supplier names
- Avoid confidentiality risks

**Alex's Agreement:**
- Sectoral benchmark = good approach
- Avoids confidentiality issues
- Still provides supplier context for self-assessment

#### 3. Monetization Strategy Discussion (Efthymios' Suggestion)

**Efthymios' Idea:**
- Don't give suppliers too much for free
- **Hide comparison/benchmark tab** unless supplier pays DitchCarbon fee
- "Give them something good, but don't give them too much"
- Sectoral benchmark comparison = potential paid feature
- First step (scorecard, trajectory, recommendations) = FREE
- Advanced features (Scope 3 detail, benchmarking) = PAID

**Alex's Response:**
- "I think that's a good suggestion"
- If suppliers want to do anything with **their Scope 3 in detail** → must pay DitchCarbon
- Main threshold: Scope 3 management = paid tier

**DitchCarbon's Supplier Pricing Model (Mentioned Earlier in Call):**
- Free tier: See your profile, scorecard, upload data
- Paid tier: Use platform for your own Scope 3 management
- **Pfizer discount:** If Pfizer suppliers want to buy DitchCarbon → "we'll make it easy" with Pfizer-specific discount
- Rationale: Support Pfizer's ecosystem, make suppliers serious about Scope 3

### Implementation Planning

**Next Steps for Interactive Dashboard:**

**Efthymios:**
- Work with Elisa (colleague) on questions
- Design questions per scope (Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3)
- Focus: "What we want to ask our suppliers to have a more clear view on their future plans"

**Alex:**
- Review Efthymios' proposed questions
- Add DitchCarbon perspective based on other customer learnings
- Combine into cohesive questionnaire
- Implement by **end of year** (realistic target)

**Testing Workflow:**
- Efthymios to claim **Pfizer's own profile** (test the supplier experience)
- Alex to send claim link to Efthymios
- Efthymios will try it out and provide feedback

**Supplier Rollout Strategy:**
- **Option A:** Mass email to 3,000 suppliers using mail merge
  - Template: "Hi [Supplier Name]. Here's the URL to claim your profile: [URL]. We'd love for you to do this and check out DitchCarbon's recommendations."
  - DitchCarbon provides: Supplier name field + URL field in export
- **Option B:** Category manager-led (one-on-one)
  - Category managers know claim profile is available
  - During supplier conversations: "Hey, let's claim their profile now. Let's see what's in here."
  - More hands-on, relationship-driven

**Efthymios' Preference:** TBD (will discuss with Elisa and Fred)

### Outstanding Action Items

**Alex Rudnicki:**
- [ ] Send supplier claim profile demo video (if not already sent)
- [ ] Send Efthymios the claim link for Pfizer's own profile (for testing)

### Key Learnings from Call

**Product-Market Fit:**
1. **Timing is everything:** Feature that wasn't ready before is now "the right time" (Efthymios validated)
2. **Interactivity = engagement:** Suppliers more likely to engage if they see their own future reflected, not just past
3. **Simplicity wins:** Efthymios explicitly rejecting survey fatigue → 3-4 questions max (not long forms)
4. **Value exchange critical:** Suppliers get trajectory visualization they may not have built internally

**Customer Success Patterns:**
5. **Avoid bureaucratic theater:** Procurement/account managers discussing sustainability without expertise = waste of time
6. **Excuse elimination:** Make it so easy that suppliers have no valid excuses (free tools, clear expectations, adequate time)
7. **Forward-looking data >> historical:** Pfizer wants to know supplier plans, not just past performance
8. **Monetization must respect free tier value:** Give enough for free to engage, charge for deep Scope 3 work

**Technical & UX Insights:**
9. **Scope 1/2 predictability >> Scope 3:** Suppliers can estimate operational emissions easier than value chain
10. **Sectoral benchmarks solve confidentiality:** Don't show competitor data, show industry trends instead
11. **Real-time interactivity = powerful:** Adjusting forecast lines as user answers questions = compelling UX
12. **Supplier self-service reduces Pfizer burden:** No more file passing, manual uploads, email chains

**Relationship Dynamics:**
13. **Collaborative product design:** Efthymios proposing specific features, Alex validating feasibility, iterating together
14. **Customer as co-creator:** Pfizer's needs directly shaping DitchCarbon roadmap (interactive dashboard by EOY)
15. **Strategic alignment:** Both parties want to avoid wasting supplier time, provide real value
16. **Transparency on monetization:** Efthymios openly suggesting "don't give too much for free" (Alex receptive)

**Strategic Context:**
17. **Fred (VP Procurement) = key stakeholder:** Engagement KPIs for his team, meeting in next few weeks
18. **KPI shift from reduction to engagement (first 2 years):** More realistic, measurable for procurement teams
19. **5-year timeline adequate:** Pfizer confident other companies reducing faster than needed for Pfizer goals
20. **Pfizer's setup ideal for DitchCarbon:** Central team + NetZero champions in sourcing zones = good structure

**Personal Development (Varun):**
21. **Proactive learning valued:** Varun specifically asked to join Pfizer call, read notes beforehand (Alex noticed)
22. **Customer calls = learning accelerator:** Seeing real customer needs vs. abstract product features
23. **First Pfizer call:** Building foundation for ongoing Pfizer relationship
