Sam, it. 
M
Moka Varun
01:00
Hello, Alex. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:01
Good morning. Good afternoon. 
M
Moka Varun
01:04
Oh yeah, it's so confusing sometimes. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:08
Yeah. How's your day going so far? 
M
Moka Varun
01:11
The day is pretty good actually. I got the laptop finally. So very excited. New laptop after eight years. So it's a kind of like, you know, begin, but it's a German keyboard. So I'm thinking. So I think I'll just learn how to use German keyboard now. Okay. It's a different layout. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:31
Get whatever you need if you need to return it. But I. After eight years, that sounds like a good milestone. Yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
01:38
My previous laptop was MacBook 2015, which I was using until yesterday. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:42
Yeah, so they hold up pretty well. But yeah, that's a long time. I. Yeah, I had the same laptop for a long time and then when I left my last job and was thinking what do I want to do next? And there were kind of six months before meeting up with Mark and starting Ditch Carbon and I was like, I think I want to do something in climate supply chain stuff. I don't know what yet. So I definitely know I'm going to be using this laptop for work. But in the meantime I also want to play the Harry Potter game that was. Oh wow. 
M
Moka Varun
02:19
You mean the Quidditch one. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
02:20
No, not the Quidditch one is the one where it's like Hogwarts. Yeah, yeah, but you're playing like 200 years before Harry Potter, you know, so it's like the old history of the wizarding world. And I was like, I definitely want to play this game and I wanted a laptop that can like do both of these things. So I bought like the nicest MacBook Pro and the guy I was buying it from was like, what do you do for work? This is like a really powerful machine. I was like, I just want to play this game. So yeah, whatever it takes. Yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
02:49
How was your day yesterday? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
02:51
It was good. It was good. So yeah, the one thing that I am so the thing that always takes the most time is when we have to deliver something non standard for a customer. So do you know the company SAP? They're like the biggest German tech company. So they are also a customer of ours and so I'm working on delivering a deliverable for them and actually I'll show you just so I can talk you through what do they want to accomplish. So I think it's helpful for you to understand the mindset of our customers. So let me show you briefly and then after that we can go into whatever questions you have for me. So. Oh, while I do this Let me just share screen so you can see how we navigate around. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
03:39
So I think you probably know this, but whenever we're working on a customer deliverable, so we have a folder in Google Drive, so sales and marketing customers, and then every customer or even prospect should have a folder here. 
M
Moka Varun
03:54
Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
03:54
If we're working on some like deliverable for SAP, then you shouldn't have to ask me where is it? It should be in the where is SAP? The SAP folder. 
M
Moka Varun
04:06
I was looking at Notions Customer, this thing and the notes. I was going through the notes because I thought you guys tracked most of the important notes there. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
04:15
Yes, that's true. So those are like notes for conversation, but when it comes to like files. Oh, that kind of thing. Then we'll save them here. 
M
Moka Varun
04:24
Okay, yeah, Interesting. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
04:26
And then you can see in the folders I'm showing you what are the deliverables. And we generally name them as like, this is bad naming because this is actually 2024. So this is the 2025 October deliverable that I'm working on. So you can see there's a lot of stuff in here. So there's not. I'm not going to put this in notion, you know. 
M
Moka Varun
04:47
Okay. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
04:47
Yeah, yeah. So this is what I'm working on for them. And so I'll just show you real briefly what they want to do. So they have every customer has slightly different logic on how they want to use our data. And so that's why we end up using these like Google Sheets, Excel type of things, is they're taking our data but they want to use it in slightly different ways. So in this case, what SAP is trying to do, so they have their top 300 suppliers here. 
M
Moka Varun
05:15
Okay. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
05:16
And they would like to segment them by some simple rules. Right. So number one, this and these are the segmentation logic that I'm pulling into their format. And then based on the segmentation of suppliers, they want to have clear next step. So that's what I'm working on filling out for them here. Right. So the first thing is like if they are not disclosing, then the next step is request disclosure. And you can use this claim profile link that we launched yesterday to do that. 
M
Moka Varun
05:49
Right. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
05:49
So if Blackline Holdings, I don't know who this company is, but if they want to claim their profile, then here's the link. 
M
Moka Varun
05:57
Yes. Right. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
05:58
And then they can just go here and so SAP can easily take the next step on this task. Right. Now let's say for the companies that are disclosing something, but they're not disclosing all the relevant categories. 
M
Moka Varun
06:15
Right. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
06:16
So then the next step here is request the missing categories. Now what are the missing categories are right here. Right. And we're interested in upstream. So upstream scope three, what is missing? Because everyone discloses scope one and two, they know they need to do that. And so we're pulling this in. Here are the missing upstream scope three categories. Right. Okay. And so then it's very clear what should I ask this customer for? Now this can also be done in the claim profile link. We give them simple instructions. So when I send this deliverable to SAP, I'm also going to send them a quick video. So I always use LOOM to give them a quick video. Talk through. Here's how you can use this. It really helps them to feel like we're taking care of them. Okay. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
06:57
But also it helps them to quickly understand, you know, how do I use this information? Yeah. So disclosing all relevant categories. If that's true, then the next step which I'm working on now is well, do they have an emission factor? If they don't, then that means they're missing revenue. So some of these companies, we are, we need to ask for revenue. Right. Because our emission factors are scope one plus two plus the upstream scope three. 
M
Moka Varun
07:30
Not downstream? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
07:32
No, downstream. And the reason for that is because the downstream is calculated by SAP somewhere else. So let's say that, let's take this as an example. Google, if I'm buying advertising from them, I'm SAP and I'm using Google for Google Ads and gcp. Right. For my hosting. Now if I use the downstream component from Google, then I'm overlapping with the electricity that I'm actually already calculating in my scope too. Yeah. Because what's the downstream? The downstream is use of sold products. So Google is saying when you use my. Whatever. If you're, you know, using Google Platform or something like that, while you're using it, you're using electricity. 
M
Moka Varun
08:29
Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
08:29
And so you're responsible for that electricity. So that's the use of sold products. But SAP is already calculating the electricity that they used from their laptops inside their office. So that would be double counting. So the downstream is actually the customers scope one oftentimes or scope two. And so that's why we don't count downstream scope three in our calculations. We do upstream scope three. So when you see our. Have you, have you looked at our export files yet? 
M
Moka Varun
08:59
Export files? No, I don't think I've seen. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
09:01
Okay, so these are, this is if you click a button in our platform, you can Export our data. I'm just looking at Oracle right now, but select all of them. So this is where I'm pulling in the data from. So you can see this is the same data you would see in our platform, but it's in spreadsheet form. So the users can export this anytime. Okay. And there's a. One of the most important data points for us is this one. It's the total upstream emission factor. So this is scope one plus two plus upstream scope three divided by revenue. And this is the one that we can use to calculate SAP our customers emissions for every dollar that they spend. Okay. And it captures everything that happened before SAP started using the product. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
09:53
But SAP will calculate their usage of the product separately in their own scope one and two. So we don't want to on that. Okay, so then this is a factor and this is always in kilogram CO2e per dollar spent. And then we can show. Okay, so where did the, this is hidden. Where did the data come from? So this is the Google documents. Yeah, we have a backup documents saved on Ditch Carbon servers. So if Google ever moves the document then we always have a backup. And then we have the. This is their scope one, all the different greenhouse gas protocol categories here. And then finally assurances. Right. So did this document get limited or reasonable assurance by an auditor? So now going back to what does SAP want to accomplish in some of these cases? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
10:48
Like this is a law firm, they have disclosed all the data that we need in order to say. Yeah, they've covered all the relevant categories but they don't disclose revenue publicly. We don't have that from S and P Global, even privately. And so SAP could ask this company or they could provide us a source of revenue. We can add that to our record for this company and then we can generate an emission factor. Okay, this is saying this is true, we have all the relevant categories, but this is fault. There's no emission factor. That means you're missing revenue. Okay, Right. Because you're missing denominator in the equation. And then the last thing that. So you can see these have a next step of request revenue. And the last thing that SAP cares about is assurance. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
11:34
So they would like all of those data points to be assured, at least with limited assurance. So I'm pulling this in here. Assurances are separated by scope. So scope one and two could be assured, but sometimes scope three is not. And so we classify this as kind of the last, this is the last step that they care about. So what SAP would be looking to use is these are true. These are all true. So we have all the data, we have an emission factor and we have limited assurance. So this is saying you can use the emission factor from Microsoft because Microsoft's data is good, they got limited from it, so their auditor has already signed off. So your auditor can be comfortable using that. 
M
Moka Varun
12:30
So you use the other emission factors which are already validated, to confirm your assurance. Something like that. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
12:37
We do not. So we are. Our position is as an aggregator of data, so we want to tell SAP, Microsoft has already gotten their data validated. Okay, Give them the source. So if you look at Microsoft here, so we don't need to be a validator, we need to show them, did Microsoft get validated? So here's the assurance fields here. So for level one, they got a limited assurance from Deloitte. And here's the text. So this is the text from the document. So we generate an emission vector from the document and we show you it was assured. So you don't need to trust Ditch Carbon because you trust Microsoft and you trust Deloitte. Right. So this is much more valid than us trying to say, oh, we've validated this data ourselves. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
13:24
Our goal is to tell you accurately, did they get limited assurance or did they not get limited assurance? And then you can make a decision on how to use the data. 
M
Moka Varun
13:33
So we have the data of Microsoft getting validated from other reports or the general backend information that we have with Microsoft, and then we provide that information to SAP, saying that, you know, this is the way they can get validated. And that information they already have validated. Yeah, yeah. So that goes for the other suppliers as well. If we have that particular information, basically, they don't have that information. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
13:57
I guess that's right, yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
13:59
Okay, interesting. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
14:00
So let's take an example of this supplier. So they have an emission factor. So there is a number, but we're saying they didn't get this number assured. And so SAP, their next step, they're not going to use this number yet. Okay, Oracle, they got an assurance. They said it was verified, but they didn't say that it's limited assurance or reasonable assurance. We don't know what level of verification. That's unspecified here. So for these two, the next step for SAP, and I'm still working on this, would be request assurance. Okay, Right. And so then you can just reach out to your supplier and say, hey, can you tell us, did you get an assurance on this document? If not, do you plan to do that next year? So they give them a little Bit of a nudge. Here's what we'd like to see next year. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
14:44
And then all of the suppliers understand that a big customer of theirs is asking them to improve and they know exactly what they need to do. And our preference is that SAP says, hey, claim your profile here and then ditch Carbon will tell you exactly what to do. And we would say, you're missing limited assurance. Get limited assurance or you're missing these categories. So get. Disclose those categories and then you're taking a step forward. So this is how we think about making it easy for SAP, but also making it easy for the suppliers to know. How do they improve and make SAP happy? And we're spending less. Everyone is spending less time finding the data, analyzing the data, and we just get straight to what's the next step to improve. That is currently done in a spreadsheet. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
15:30
But what I'm developing as our next big product is basically putting this into the web app so SAP can decide on what are their criteria. Yeah, you can separate the suppliers by those criteria and then easily send these claim profile links, which will tell the supplier, here's what SAP wants you to do. All right, so that's the next step. That's what we're trying to build over, let's say by the end of the year. And I can send you a video so you can see what that looks like. Let's see. Improve. I might need to. I'll hunt this down and send it to you. Okay, cool. So any questions on what SAP is trying to accomplish? So they want to use as many of the. They want all of these suppliers to have an emission factor. Yeah, they have an emission factor that's assured. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
16:23
And then they would use it in their reporting. 
M
Moka Varun
16:26
Yes, I. The thing is, we are talking about this new feature of the claim, right? So when all these suppliers start claiming their profiles, right, and they have to update all the information that SAP needs for them to update that information, does it come to us, to our backend, or does it only go to SAP, or do you see any kind of conflict where they're like, comes to us, it comes. So that is like, basically default. There's no scenario where, like, we only share the data with SAP, but not with any other party, something like that. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
16:58
So we actually give the supplier a choice. Okay, so does this. There's a choice. When they upload their document, do they want to keep it private or do they want to make it available to everyone? And we. We make it. It's like a very small, like, cookie kind of thing, right? We don't want it to be obvious. We want everyone to give us their public. Their data publicly. Yeah, it's actually for the supplier. It's good. Like do you want 10 companies to ask you this question or just one? 
M
Moka Varun
17:23
Absolutely. Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
17:24
We will respect, especially with something like a PCF that is maybe more sensitive than the private data becomes more important. But for this, like did you get assurance if you went through the process of getting your data audited, you want everyone to know that. Right, exactly. So it just means that it was. We couldn't find it, so you should give that to us. And then now everyone knows that you did the work. That's a good. Yeah, yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
17:48
That makes sense. That makes sense about auditing as well. Like how do we track, you know, the assurance of all the companies, like generally in case. Like as Digarbon because we have so much database. Right, right. And I feel the assurance differs from sector to sector. It's not the same process that is followed because the. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
18:13
It's standardized in terms of the requirements for carbon data. It's standardized. So you have requirements by many governments now. Yeah, including I believe in India for the bse, you have a requirement to get a certain type of assurance. 
M
Moka Varun
18:31
Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
18:32
They will specify like is it limited assurance, is it reasonable assurance? These are internationally recognized terms for how closely the auditor needs to check your data. And the reason they're standardized is because it's the same thing for financial data. 
M
Moka Varun
18:48
Yeah, I want to learn more about them. Can you send me materials like if you have any? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
18:54
I think this is a good. Just like chappie check chatgpt conversation about like tell me about which governments have required. 
M
Moka Varun
19:03
No, I thought like we track some kind of information like because we have so much company database. Like with respect to. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
19:10
We do so. Yeah, that's what I was showing you in. And it's based on a document level. So I'll show you that now. So each document has its own level of assurance because we pull the assurance out of a document. So let's just look at this real quick. So we go back into our database and let's just look at Apple. And so within. Oh, Apple. Takes forever to load because there's so many documents. Let's look at something else that will go a little bit faster. Air liquid. Okay, so air liquid. So we have the main. You can see there's one main document here for 2024. There are others, but this is the main one that's producing the most information. Or like 2023, for example, you have two documents here that you can click into. So let's look at this. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
20:04
You can see the original document here and the. The link on digit carbon server in case this one's ever broken. Here are the data points that we extracted, by the way. You'll see in some cases. So this, there is no, there's no human entered information here. 
M
Moka Varun
20:21
Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
20:21
As a robot extracted this. So this was extracted by our AI. So you can see this is what it got. But if you see information here, that means someone on our QA team has extracted the data instead. 
M
Moka Varun
20:32
Yeah, that's basically human in the loop validation kind of. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
20:36
That's right, yeah. Or sometimes the robot always tries first and then sometimes we have a signal say we think this might be wrong. So then humans fix it. Now here's the assurance that our robot got from this document. So you can see we got limited assurance. This is the text that we captured. So it says this engagement carried out by blah, blah. We always make it. We want to make it easy for the user to find this if they want more information. And then this is statutory auditors. Aaron Liquid. So that's like a French way of saying there are sometimes multiple auditors. So now if we go and check the original document, my hope is that we can always search for this and find it. Sometimes it's slightly different on formatting, but here we go. So we find the. There we go. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
21:28
I think this is the. Yeah. Certification of sustainability. So now I found the correct location and it's saying statutory auditors. At the bottom, it will actually give the name of the auditor usually. So the robots extract it accurately. But like more accurate would be Price WaterhouseCooper. Right. But we still end KPMG. So there are two auditors on this document. So this is, you know, two pages out of a 400 page document. 
M
Moka Varun
21:57
Oh, that's. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
21:59
We captured the key information there and then we turn it into a simple field so that for the user they can just see, okay, I see the data that came out of this document. I see that it got limited assurance and that's good enough. We also pull targets out in a similar way. So we have these two targets that were mentioned in the document and then you have these documents which if we go back to the organization view. So this is a company, Air Liquid, based in France. And you can see that it has many documents. It owns something like 44 documents that it currently owns. Four of them are processing right now. So these ones are in process. They look like they're stuck actually because it's Been a while. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
22:43
So sometimes our system gets stuck and that's kind of one of the big problems we're trying to deal with right now with our engineering team. And then we can see all the years of data. Sometimes these are all global disclosures, but sometimes they'll have like disclosure just for France or India, some region. You capture those as well. Here's the different initiatives that this organization is a part of. Here's their revenue. You can see we pull in from S and P. And then here's the corporate hierarchy of all the companies it owns. So this is the organization profile view. And so going back to what does the user see when they export the data or when they look at it? In our web app, in this case there are two documents that are merged together. Right. So these two both have valuable information. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
23:35
In this case there's only one that we're using for that year, in this case 2. And so if we go into the web app now and we look at Air Liquid, so if we look at Air Liquid, we can see the documents here that were used in that disclosure. We can see not every document has assurance, but some of them do. So the same field here, but displayed for the user. Here's the assurance that we pulled out those same fields that I showed you. So we make it available in the web app in the export file and we can change it all on the back end system if it looks like it's not correct. And you can see those documents that we're refreshing right now. 
M
Moka Varun
24:28
Are you talking about the extraction? Like you just mentioned, that engineering team is having some issues with the. Is it the extraction process? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
24:37
No, it's. Sometimes there are many steps in that process. So yeah, you can call it extraction, but really it's the research process. So it's an entire, let's say 25 steps that a document would go through. And then when a document changes, this organization profile may change. Right. Because maybe there's a new document that's more relevant than an old document. So there's lots of logic in the system to make it update automatically. And sometimes documents can get stuck. So these ones look like they're stuck because I see they were updated a week or two ago and they are still in this status. They're in created. So they look like they are stuck here. And created, instead of moving all the way through this process down to synced is usually that means it's kind of done and not doing anything. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
25:28
So I would expect that this is stuck right now. And so this is something they're Working on is finding the. The causes for. Why does this get stuck basically. 
M
Moka Varun
25:40
Have you guys thought about like. Like you know, converting the PDF into a machine readable format where the extraction is much more simpler. You have to take snapshots always. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
25:53
No, it's. It's in a machine readable format as well. We. We extract the text. So we're not doing OCR unless we can't extract the text. 
M
Moka Varun
26:03
I wanted to ask about OCR because recently there was this deep SEQ OCR the new one and it has much greater capacity and power to even extract images because even I was thinking of using it to how to integrate into the knowledge graph that I was creating because for me the extraction process is a little bit difficult. I miss out sometimes the tables and little bit of the data. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
26:29
Yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
26:30
So it's little difficult to capture those notes and hyper edges and I thought I'll use the deep sea Cosia and then when I did research I realized I have to spend $15,000. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
26:41
Yeah, yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
26:42
And get an Nvidia GPU that is out of the picture. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
26:46
Yeah, yeah. No, it's good. So this is a good conversation to bring up with the dev team as well. It's like hey, when I was you know doing my side project I was looking into this and I'm wondering if you've thought about that it could be useful. 
M
Moka Varun
26:57
Like I said, is actually pretty interesting and a lot of people have especially in the image capture format where it's able to convert. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
27:06
We use something, I think it's called URL box which is image capture. If we are capturing no URL box turns a website page like HTML page into a PDF. And then there's something else that does what you're talking about but I think it can be improved. So you should share your suggestions like I said. Yeah, right. 
M
Moka Varun
27:28
I want to talk about the knowledge graph also on Hyper Register because I think it's much easier to create those semantic relationships especially so because here you're tracking the vector databases. It's much easier in knowledge graph. I want to try that and I'll. I can explain it much easier fan example. So I'll do that once. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
27:48
Yeah, you should have you had a one one with Charlie. 
M
Moka Varun
27:50
No, I have not had. I was planning to ask him. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
27:54
Yeah, you should have a one one with Charlie next week. Yeah. By the way, on Thursdays we always do no meeting Thursdays for the devs. 
M
Moka Varun
28:00
Okay. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
28:01
They can finish up the sprint in a strong way. 
M
Moka Varun
28:05
Today's okay. We don't have this. I didn't realize. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
28:09
No stand up today usually. Yeah. So just so you know. Yeah. And then. So, yeah, maybe next week have a meeting with Charlie, and I think it'd be fun for you to talk with him. So Charlie is the primary platform engineer, and when we say platform, we mean research. Yeah. He's very focused on the nitty gritty of how do we make all the. How do we go from, like, just a supplier name to a profile that works. He and I have done a lot of the design on that together, but me, as the kind of user, him is the engineer. So I would say of everyone on the team, he's the most knowledgeable about how we do that. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
28:50
And so he would want to hear your suggestions, because usually he and I are deciding, like, okay, what's the priority to improve our research platform from here? And we kind of set the roadmap for what he. And he usually works with Gaurav as well, in order to build that. 
M
Moka Varun
29:06
I'm very excited to talk to Charlie. I will soon talk to him. 
A

And then that's the best part of our job, because I think you're not a developer, but you have some technical awareness, which is one of the reasons I wanted to bring you onto the team. Because when you're working on delivering for customers, you are helping us today. But you can also observe here are some things that I think are not working well, and maybe they could better. And then you can make suggestions. And I think you'll be able to navigate when our system is not working. 
M
Moka Varun
29:35
Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
29:35
The way we expect it to. Sometimes it's not working. And I think given you understand how systems work to a fair degree, you'll be able to understand this. Feels like something is a. There's a bug here, right? Yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
29:47
I'm not expert at it, but I'm very excited because it's a new thing while learning, while developing something on my own as well. So there's a lot for me to learn as well. I'm not an expert, but, like, the thing is, like, I have also not got any review on my code base yet. Like, from. From an external person so far. Yeah, a lot. And I'm very excited to, you know, talk to Charlie about it because he understands the concept as well. It's not just like, you know, coding, but also the main idea. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
30:15
And so. So two things I want to talk with you about before and then any questions you have for. For me, we can definitely extend the. The one one a little bit. So the first thing is with your side project, so while you're employed with Ditch Carbon. I'm okay with you working on it. But it should be a clear thing about like, you know, that you're working for our business. And I actually hope your best ideas. And you see it as like, you want to help build our business. Right. Because in many ways they are the same thing or they're similar. Right. 
M
Moka Varun
30:46
And so yeah, of course, like, I, I, I, I don't have any, this thing that I want to do everything on my own app. I can't do that. Like, and I need help also. So it's always going to be a teamwork kind of thing, whether I do with you or maybe if I get an opportunity sometime in future. Okay. We don't know that. So I am not too much focused on like, you know, what will happen after six months. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
31:07
So what I would say. So what I would say is the best case scenario as far as I'm concerned, is that you prove that you're a valuable member of our core team. Yeah. And we want to give you ownership, some ownership in the business. So options in the company. Charlie has options in the company. Right. Like we hope to give every core member of the team some ownership. Yeah. Right. And so that you are kind of fully aligned with us, that we want to just grow this business and keep building. So then what I hope is if that's your goal as well, then any kind of good ideas that you had for what you were working on before, you now have a team that can help make it happen much faster. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
31:51
And we haven't raised a lot of money, but we've raised some money. And yes, we already have big customers. So anything that you want to have happen, if it's a good idea, we'll take the good idea and make it happen faster and bigger. 
M
Moka Varun
32:03
Absolutely. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
32:04
Absolutely. 
M
Moka Varun
32:05
I even, I have the same mindset as well. Nothing different actually, because that kind of helps me a lot to achieve the target faster. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
32:13
Yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
32:13
And I have to earn the, Even if I have to get some value in the company, I have to earn it. Not just like, you know, it's just. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
32:21
A standard, it's a standard process. Six months, just anyone that we bring on. Actually, when I first started working with Mark, we said, let's treat it like a six month trial. Yeah. And see if we like working together. And if not, then it's fine, we'll go our separate ways. But six months, that's kind of a period where we can really feel out working together and we know if there's something good and then at the end of the six month mark, we're like, yep, let's do it. You know, co founders. Same thing with Cam. Same thing with everyone on the team. Charlie actually interned with us for a year before becoming a full time employee, so. Interesting. Yeah, yeah. Because he's. He's actually still a student. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
32:58
So he's a student, I think. Oh, yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
33:00
Without trying. So he's like, I have enough time to work full time because I just need to do like, you know, I sit in these classes and I know why the professor who is talking about AI is wrong. This is kind of funny. But. But yeah, so that's the first point. I hope that you basically take all the energy, time, ideas, make it part of our business. Like make your stamp on the business because we can grow it a lot faster and we have people like you that really want to do this. Like, this is actually the main reason I wanted to hire you is because I can see that you have demonstrated that this is your passion. 
M
Moka Varun
33:37
Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
33:38
And that's also how I feel. Everyone on the team, we want them to feel like this is the most important work that they can do for the next 10 years and build a big business doing that. Right. So that's the first point. The second point is, would you like to meet with some of the team in the uk? 
M
Moka Varun
33:57
You mean personally? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
33:59
Yes. 
M
Moka Varun
34:00
Yeah, I don't mind. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
34:01
Yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
34:02
That's you. Going to UK is my dream. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
34:04
Okay. So I guess we'll have to probably figure out the visa stuff is. Is my question because now they're. Because of Brexit, which is so annoying. Or maybe we can figure out some way where we meet up in the eu. We do like a team meetup. If it's inconvenient for you to get to the UK for some reason. 
M
Moka Varun
34:24
EU is also fine by me. Both. I'm okay with that. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
34:27
So Mark's suggestion was come out to the uk. 
M
Moka Varun
34:30
Yeah. Because a lot of people are in EU already this Marcelo and Veronica as well. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
34:35
Yeah, yeah. But just. We'll definitely do a bigger team meetup as well. But. But given that you're onboarding, it's nice to maybe meet up with the team sooner. So that's the idea. I will probably be in the UK in January because we have a conference that we go to every year. It's called the Scope three peer group. Very good group of. I know, I know the biggest companies that are all trying to decarbonize their supply chains and they kind of meet and talk together. We're quite close with that group, so. 
M
Moka Varun
35:06
I know the group. I forgot the name. Do you remember the name? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
35:11
Which one? 
M
Moka Varun
35:12
The person. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
35:14
Yeah, yeah. Ollie. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he's. He's a. He's a close friend of Mark's. Oh, very interesting. Yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
35:21
So I've spoken to him on LinkedIn. Like, I have contacted him on LinkedIn. Like, we had, like, few conversations, but, like, not very deep. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
35:29
So he said yeah to our company. 
M
Moka Varun
35:31
Very interesting. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
35:32
Yes. He's an advisor to the company. We know him quite well. So he. I always go to his conference in Chicago every year and then a conference in London every year. So London will be in January, so I'm sure I'll be out for that one. And maybe that's the opportunity to have Marcello and Veronica come out as well. We'll see. But we. We may be able to do something sooner just for you to go meet the team because it's so close. You know, we could just get you a quick flight or even a train, depending. So I'll talk with Mark and if you can just look into what would be the visa requirement for you to go to the uk? Probably for like three or four days, nothing to. Nothing super long. So it's maybe like a tourist visa is all you need. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
36:22
And then just. So next time we talk about it, you have that context. That would be good. 
M
Moka Varun
36:26
Sure, Yeah, I look into it. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
36:30
Okay, sounds good. All right, so that's it. On my side, anything that you wanted to talk with me about or ask me about? 
M
Moka Varun
36:37
I wanted to ask about one thing. I saw that you're working on the KPIs of Pfizer, so I wanted to know, like, if I can help you in that. Because, like, I thought I look into the competitor sustainability reports and I can look into something and is there anything I can do? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
36:55
They are trying to figure out their plan right now. So we had a call with them the last few days and have another call with them this morning coming up. Do they reschedule that? Yeah, it looks like they. Oh, no, we do have. I do have another one coming up. So let's. Let me invite you to this call coming up just so you can shadow. But basically they're still trying to figure out exactly what type of KPIs they want to set. So we had a call with their, like, number two sustainability person yesterday. And essentially they are thinking about what targets can they set for the procurement team internally. 
M
Moka Varun
37:50
Okay. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
37:51
That will align with their external goal of absolute reduction in scope, 3 by x amount, by 2030. And so the procurement team, they're trying to decide, you know, should we set a reduction goal for them that's kind of hard for them to think about, or should they set something more like an engagement target? So right now it looks like they will be. We will give them the top. Here are the top 120 suppliers you really need to focus on. Here are the ones that are not on track to hit their targets. Here are the ones that haven't even set targets. So, like, we looked with SAP, very clear segmentation. Yeah. And then that central team will work with each of the key procurement teams to basically say, here are your top 10 suppliers. Okay. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
38:37
And your KPI is you need to talk with each of them this year, and you need to show them this, and you need to ask, what is their plan? And then report back to us. That's the key. Right. And you need to talk with all 10 of them and get their response. So it's more like engaging with them to show the supplier that this target is important to us versus you need to reduce this much. They want to set engagement KPI maybe for the first two years, and then track reduction out to 20, 30. Okay. Okay. I'll let you know if there's anything we can. We can work on. But right now it's kind of like we're just advisors for them to help them think what's possible. Yeah, we'll work on it later. 
M
Moka Varun
39:17
But I saw the notes. I saw the notes. Like, it was very interesting. So I went through a little bit of the notes of Pfizer. So I thought, like, I'll ask and. Because I wanted to look into it myself. As in what I can find something interesting. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
39:30
Yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
39:31
So if I find something interesting, I'll send the materials to you. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
39:34
Sure, sure. Sounds good. Anything else? 
M
Moka Varun
39:37
No, nothing. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
39:39
Okay, let me also, I'll let you know how we think about payroll. Right. Yeah. On some paying employees. So you've been working with us for this week. So you can bill us for the. It'll be five work days. Yeah. So just prorate, you know, five work days out of how many total work days in a month. Yeah. And you can send us an invoice. So have you ever done that before? 
M
Moka Varun
40:04
I have not done, but I have to send invoice for the laptop as well. So I'll send it together. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
40:09
So the laptop, you can submit an expense, and that's through zero and you. Oh, yeah. So expenses are different at the end of every month. So let's say the last week of Every month you can send an invoice for the next month. It would just be your standard monthly. But this month it's five days. Five work days. So send me a prorated amount. Okay. And you can send it to financeitchcarbon.com. 
M
Moka Varun
40:38
Got it. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
40:39
And then we alwasy pay invoices the last Friday. Okay. Of every month. 
M
Moka Varun
40:45
Okay. Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
40:46
So tomorrow we'll be running payroll, and I just do them all at the same time. It's okay if you end up sending it late. I'll pay it as soon as we can after that. But it's just convenient if you send it so that we have it before the last Friday of each month. 
M
Moka Varun
41:00
Okay. So you want it by Friday? This Friday? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
41:02
Yes. 
M
Moka Varun
41:03
Okay, I do it. Yeah. Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
41:07
And I will go ahead and send you a template so you can see what should be in there. 
M
Moka Varun
41:12
Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
41:13
And that would be a reference. Okay. 
M
Moka Varun
41:14
Yeah, sure. Thank you. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
41:16
All right. Okay. I think we're good here. 
M
Moka Varun
41:19
Yeah, sure. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
41:20
Okay, then I'll see you later for the Pfizer call. Sure. That one. The Pfizer call will be pretty casual. It's two of the kind of working level employees who we are with, and I'm not sure exactly what they want to talk about. It'll be something tactical. I think they want the claim profiles. They want to know how to use it, so. 
M
Moka Varun
41:38
Okay. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
41:38
That's my expectation. 
M
Moka Varun
41:40

Okay, cool. No worries. I'll just look into it, read about it. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
41:43
Okay. All right. See you in a bit. Yep. Bye. Bye.
