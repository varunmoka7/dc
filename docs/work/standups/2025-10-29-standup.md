### Alex Rudnicki - Customer Success & Product

**Customer Engagements:**

**Fizer:**

**Denu Data Issue Resolution:**

- Validated DitchCarbon's automated process accuracy
- **Technical Issue:** Google's combined Scope 3.2 + 3.11 disclosure
  - DitchCarbon rejects this (non-compliance with GHG protocol standards)
  - Greenhouse gas protocol requires separate category reporting

**Renewals Progress:**
- **Howden:** Likely to renew and upgrade (planning first procurement disclosure)
- **Spend HQ:** Reached out, anticipating renewal

**Deliverables:**
- **SAP:** Plan to export and send data (assuming quality good after Mahit's processing)

**Product Coordination:**
- **Claim Profile Launch:** Discussed filming product video with Marcello
  - Suggestion: Claim "ditch carbon" org as demo
- **Recommendation UX:** Provided feedback to Marcello
  - "Fill in your data" should always appear first
  - Target: Simplify for suppliers who haven't disclosed or missing categories

**Daily Focus:**
- Send out product demos
- Respond to Charlie's questions on tickets
- Check onboarding materials for "greatest hits"

---

### Moka Varun - Onboarding

**Focus:**
- Learning about process, platform, and target customers
- Reading about "Howden" and their sustainability data
- Continuing to learn product and platform

**Alex's Recommendation:**
- Investigate Coherent's project (largest scale DitchCarbon currently handles)
