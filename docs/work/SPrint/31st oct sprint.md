Yeah. Hi, G. Hi, Mark. G. Are you from Pune? 
G
Gourav Sen
00:16
I'm from Central. 
M
Marc Munier
00:19
Jen. 
M
Marc Munier
00:19
Oh, Jen. 
M
Moka Varun
00:20
Okay. I know. 
C
Charlie Groves
00:21
Nice. 
M
Marc Munier
00:23
So we need to look at the nationalities here. We've got two Indians and three English on the call. We need to maybe get one more Indian so it's equal. 
C
Charlie Groves
00:31
We can. 
M
Marc Munier
00:33
Mix it up a bit. Just wait for Alex to join. 
G
Gourav Sen
00:37
Thank God. You said adding one person. 
M
Marc Munier
00:43
Really got. 
M
Marc Munier
00:43
We've only got one Taiwanese, though, so I think. I think one is enough. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
00:49
Taiwanese on the team. 
M
Marc Munier
00:51
What's that? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
00:52
Are you talking about sunny ones enough? 
M
Marc Munier
00:57
One's enough. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:03
Did I tell you, Sonny, I actually confirmed my au pair coming over from China. She's from Shenzhen, so mainland China, but. But I'll have a Chinese native speaker in the house starting in January. So excited. 
M
Marc Munier
01:16
That's pretty cool. Hopefully your Chinese will improve because Sonny. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:20
Says it was really bad, so that's totally. It's getting. It's getting worse by the day, so that's totally fair. 
M
Marc Munier
01:26
Yeah. So I don't want to have a too. Too jovial. Too jovial a note. So, yeah, short answer is Cam's left the business. He made a pretty bold request to increase his ownership of the business, which I was not willing to grant him. When I said this, he sort of threatened to scorch the earth and sort of email everyone telling everyone that, you know, what an I was and all the rest of it sort of thing. Which, to be fair, he has already emailed all of our shareholders, so he's true to his word. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
02:06
So. 
M
Marc Munier
02:10
Hey, Veronica. 
M
Marc Munier
02:11
Hey, hey, hey. Hello. 
M
Marc Munier
02:13
She's there. Yeah. So I was just letting everyone know that Cam's left the business. So it doesn't really. For some reason, Veronica's pinned. But anyway, so, anyway, so that's as of sort of effective immediately. He may well be helping us out on a contracting basis, but that's up to him. He'll keep any options that he's accrued to date. Genuinely, and I say this with no sort of agenda or anything, he's absolutely fantastic engineer and a fantastic bloke. He just sort of misjudged the situation to the extent that I lost. I just didn't feel like I could trust him anymore. Which is a real shame because he's a lovely bloke and as I say, has contributed a huge amount to Digital Carbon. So he remains very much a friend and, yeah, great at what he does. We have a transition plan in place. 
M
Marc Munier
03:04
We will be hiring senior engineer to replace him. We're going to start that right now. It might take a Little while to find somebody. In the meantime, Alex will be assuming direct management responsibility for the engineering team. So, apologies, other American, but what are you going to do? So happy to answer any questions about anything at all. This can be unsettling, so I wanted to give everyone the opportunity to ask any questions. 
C
Charlie Groves
03:38
Max. 
M
Max Tancock
03:42
Is there anything just from a sales perspective that I have been talking about that is was potentially going to come up that I need to perhaps stop talking about and just be aware of it's going to be slower because we obviously have personality questions. 
M
Marc Munier
03:55
That's a great question, Max. Yeah, we will move a little slower. Cam has been working really fucking hard and in a mainly sort of unseen way. And so that will slow us down in terms of product dev? I don't think so because I think we're not promising anything by due dates to people. We're saying, look, maturity benchmarks coming, you know, that sort of thing. And as ever, if we have a customer that really needs something, we will react quickly and reallocate resources. So, you know, it's a great opportunity, I think, for Marcello Grove and Charlie to step up even more. They're already working really hard, but it's an opportunity for them to take more responsibility, make more sort of strategic decisions on our product and all these other. 
M
Max Tancock
04:44
Sort of good things. 
M
Marc Munier
04:47
So I think, yes, we have to accept that we will not be shipping quite as fast as we have previously, but not to the extent that will dent our ambition as a business. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
04:58
I think the other thing I would add to that, Mark, it was something that we talked about. It's just like the pace that we're currently shipping is almost to the point where we can't even talk about it fast enough before something new comes. And so we actually do have a lot from the customer standpoint to be able to say. There's a lot of new things already coming. Like we just shipped team recommendations as of today or yesterday. We shipped claim profile and we had our first. Pfizer has claimed their profile and they're happy to start sending it to their suppliers. We will be rolling that out. We'll talk about the marketing outbound side of it, but that's going to start coming. So we already have a thousand organizations that have been claimed in a day. So that's just the latest thing. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
05:46
Supplier maturity modules next. I think it's fair to assume that it will go slower than it would have otherwise, but I think we had a pretty clear plan. So that's what's coming next. 
M
Marc Munier
05:57
And Alex, anything else to add to what I said in opening just to make sure everyone sort of. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
06:03
No, I would just say, like, at the end of the day, you know, we're building a business that I think has high impact potential and everyone that's here is aligned on that. Otherwise we wouldn't be doing this. 
M
Moka Varun
06:15
Right. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
06:15
And so as long as that stays the case, then I think that, you know, everything is going our way. It may take a little bit longer to get to where we need to go. But, you know, as Mark said, I think that's an opportunity for everyone here to step up as well and do, you know, take on more responsibility, especially on the dev team, do a little bit more. But I think we have the right people in place to continue to make progress. So, yeah, it's going to be interesting. 
G
Gourav Sen
06:43
Good. 
M
Marc Munier
06:43
Any other questions? 
M
Marc Munier
06:45
I. 
M
Marc Munier
06:45
By the way, I'm really enjoying that Charlie wasn't the first one to ask a question this time. So this is good, this is a good behavior. And Gura second, I like. Let's just, let's just keep Charlie down. Let's just try that as much as we can go for a girl. 
G
Gourav Sen
07:01
Architectural dependency, like on the side of GCP and all those. So how we are going to handle that? 
M
Marc Munier
07:09
So in what way? As in who's going to be managing that moving forward? So there was a, there was discussion around bringing you along. You know, I know that this is not an area of your expertise right now, but we definitely like to upskill you in that area. So that's something that we're going to do. We have some contractors on standby if we need them. What we're hoping is that we're not going to change anything big anytime soon. So, you know, it's a good opportunity for, you know, and I would say actually, Gaurav, if there's any, we've got contractors as a backup if we need them. If you see a training course or something like that you think would accelerate your learning, then very happy to sort of fund that, just let us know. 
M
Marc Munier
07:47
So I think that's the move, isn't it, Alex, to sort of move grav into that infrastructure, play as soon as possible, have contractors as backup. And yeah, I think we're through the chaotic era on the GCP side for a while anyway. So I think awful gap and if it does, we'll have to just pay and get contractors in Max. 
M
Marcello Ruja
08:09
Yeah. 
M
Max Tancock
08:10
So thinking about replacement. Cam was obviously integral and a co founder. So he, beyond just being a really good engineer, had a strategic role in Ditch Carbon. How are you thinking of replacing that at all. Like you said mentioned senior engineer. Is this somebody who has, like, management experience? 
M
Marc Munier
08:31
He's also got strategic experience. 
M
Max Tancock
08:33
Like, how do you replace the big shoes that Cam was wearing? 
M
Marc Munier
08:39
Yeah, it's a good question. I think we're going to see what the market gives us in terms of engineering talent. I don't think we're rushing to put a management role back in place in the engineering team there. You know, there's opportunity for everyone to progress within the engineering team. It just depends what the market shows us in terms of who we hire. Our board is actually pretty technical. So when it comes to strategic direction, from a technology point of view, we've got good input there. So the view is not to hire a CTO at this stage. They're just very difficult hires. They're really difficult because they can command enormous salaries in the open market. 
M
Marc Munier
09:27
and so you have to find one that wants to go back to startup land, which is fun, you know, but then has to give up a big salary and then has to join somebody else's. I don't know, maybe it's a bit like a second marriage, you know, like, it's a little bit more difficult. So I think, yeah, the chances of success hiring a CTO at this stage, I think is very low. So that's one of the reasons that we're not going to do that. I don't think so. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
09:55
Think of it more like looking for a player coach. Yeah, yeah. 
M
Marc Munier
09:58
As opposed to anything else. But I. Yeah, I think the. I think on the strategic direction side. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
10:05
I think we're okay. 
M
Marc Munier
10:07
Alex is very strong on the product side. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
10:11
So. 
M
Marc Munier
10:12
Yeah, good question, though. Anybody else? That was a good one. 
M
Moka Varun
10:16
Anyone? 
M
Marc Munier
10:17
Beat that question for making me squirm. 
C
Charlie Groves
10:22
There. 
M
Marc Munier
10:23
Charlie's allowed to ask questions now. 
S
Sunny Hsiao
10:27
Fraction of CTO days. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
10:33
Sunny, I couldn't really hear you clearly. Can you see that? 
M
Marc Munier
10:35
Yeah, it was really bad. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
10:38
I think your headphones are off or something. 
M
Marc Munier
10:43
Is wild. Sunny's doing that. Anybody else want to ask a question? 
C
Charlie Groves
10:49
Is there a rough timeline for hiring or is it just as soon as. 
M
Marc Munier
10:54
We can find someone is what we're looking for. I should say as well, we have revoked cams, access to pretty much everything and updated API keys in production. So you might see some weirdness. So if you do just flag it. Things don't work as you think they should, either as an engineer or as a other person in the team, then just let us know. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
11:17
Okay, Charlie, My guess is January, Just to give you kind of a rough sense. 
C
Charlie Groves
11:22
Okay. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
11:23
Just. That's my guess on how it will work. 
M
Marc Munier
11:27
It takes at least a month to find somebody and then notice period. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
11:31
And it's holidays. Yeah. 
S
Sunny Hsiao
11:35
Can you hear me now? 
M
Marc Munier
11:36
We can. 
S
Sunny Hsiao
11:37
Sorry, I think my headphone doesn't work. I say fractional ctl, as in someone in CTL level, but comes in one. 
C
Charlie Groves
11:43
Or two days, but he's still like at that level. 
M
Marc Munier
11:46
I do have somebody that I can do that. I have somebody actually. Charlie knows him. John, who was actually our original CTO when it was just me. He's a Rails legend and could do that if we required him to. I think we're just gonna let the dust settle. It's been a pretty emotional day for me already so far, so I think we just need to get into our new groo, see how we go for a couple of weeks. November is a pretty critical period for us just in terms of commercial, so I want to focus most of my efforts on closing deals, which is kind of my job. And Alex will take the reins in an interim way, I suppose, for now on the engineering management side. And we'll take it from there. Yeah, it is a consideration. 
M
Marc Munier
12:39
We have an option if we need it. I'm not sure we need it. Part of the value that Ditch Carbon has is that we are quite small and so communication is quite easy between engineers, despite time zone differences and all. 
C
Charlie Groves
12:52
The rest of it. 
M
Marc Munier
12:53
So I think we don't want to suddenly get, you know, the bigger it gets, the more complicated those things become to do, to manage. 
C
Charlie Groves
13:03
Good. 
M
Marc Munier
13:03
What else? 
M
Marc Munier
13:06
If not, we're going to do Sprint Retro, which. Which Max and Sunny can stay for if they want. 
M
Max Tancock
13:15
I haven't had lunch yet, so. 
M
Marc Munier
13:16
Yeah, fair enough. Lunch is calling, so that's fine. So Alex and I, if you have any questions for either of us, just let us know. 
C
Charlie Groves
13:25
Yeah. 
M
Marc Munier
13:26
If Cam reach out, he's definitely a friend of the business, but, you know, they'll be sending him API keys, so. 
C
Charlie Groves
13:35
Yeah. 
M
Marc Munier
13:35
Anything else? Yeah, messages, slack, whenever you want. It's totally fine. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
13:40
Okay. 
M
Marc Munier
13:42
All right, thank you. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
13:43
If you want to stay or if you want to hop, that's up to you as well. Let's go ahead and. And thanks, Sunny. Max, let's go ahead and transition into Sprint Register. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
13:53
Yeah, I have to. I have a doctor's appointment, guys, so. 
M
Marc Munier
13:56
I have no worries. 
M
Marcello Ruja
13:59
See you soon. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
14:02
All right, so Sprint Retro. So for Mocus benefit. So your first Sprint Retro. We talked a bit about this before, but we have a two week Sprint cadence. And so this is the end of our Sprint, which is called Strontium for the element in the periodic table. And so really we make it simple. What went well? What could we have done better? And then tactically what do we need to do this weekend in order to kind of start off the next week with a fully refreshed database? You know, with our tech in a good position before that we'll do a quick stand up. So okay, go ahead and just run a normal stand up here first. We'll try and keep it really tight. Charlie, would you like to start us off? 
C
Charlie Groves
14:47
Yeah, sure, I will share my screen so got some update yesterday, lots of code review and fixed some stuff to help Alex deliver for SAP. So I changed how we are exporting assurances in the organization data export to show the highest level of assurance we have for each year rather than just the first one. I do think, and I mentioned this in the Slack thread Alex that we need maybe a separate assurance export here where we have all assurances for every document in a performance. Maybe that's a separate file or a different tab on the same spreadsheet because the data we have right now still isn't properly represented in that 2D table. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
15:32
Agreed. 
C
Charlie Groves
15:34
I pushed a fix to initiative cascading in the dashboard data export which was flagged by eth. Both of these fixes I confirmed production closed out those tickets then few issues. Mahit's team was trying to upload a document which was larger than our maximum size so Garav actions and fixed with basically no input from me and worked on building using our document embeddings for legal entity extraction because to clean up document. Org resolution stuff this would be a lot cheaper to do that. Then this morning I refreshed some API tokens. I specked out two new tickets so one so we get a Slack message when someone interacts with our new chatbot and another one to backfill kensho candidates. 
C
Charlie Groves
16:30
Now we have like a global cash pool for them so this will even further reduce our usage there because we'll be able to reuse every request we've already made. I thought that was quite a neat solution to that also helped Max with I explained more about how our entity resolution algorithm works and how it prioritizes the tree over the exact company if not enough data is provided by the customer to help them out on that and just fixed the industry bug for Eth. Any questions on any of that? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
17:05
Oh good. 
M
Marcello Ruja
17:10
Keep it short. 
G
Gourav Sen
17:11
So there were some improvements on enabling the prioritization of the target. So I updated logic and the UI on my local and left a comment on Ticket. So Alex, whenever you get chance please look into it and if all good. 
C
Charlie Groves
17:24
I will push it. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
17:25
So this is all pushed already? Pushed to prod? 
G
Gourav Sen
17:28
No, no, it's not pushed to produce on my local right now. So if you give a, I will push it. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
17:34
Okay. 
G
Gourav Sen
17:35
After that I worked on the 205, 2025 aggregation for existing organization. The PR is under review for that and for refactoring of the emission data change detection, the task is completed and PR is managed as well. And for the organization pipeline calculating and caching steps. The PR is currently in the review. So yeah, that's it, pretty much. No blockers. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
18:06
Okay Marcello, congrats today. Yesterday was a launch day for a client profile in terms of actually getting one user to use it. 
M
Marc Munier
18:19
Where's the thousand number come from? Alex, I don't understand. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
18:22
So Pfizer claims one corporate tree. They get access to. I don't know how many entities Pfizer has. I don't think that's all Pfizer. I think somehow someone else may have claimed a profile. But this is what I'm waiting for. An update on Marcello on I need basic CRUD access to know exactly what's going on. You're muted. Oops. 
M
Marcello Ruja
18:49
Cool, so I'll continue then and thanks. Yesterday I fixed the dashboard export. Now we are exporting public URL. Finally public pages URLs updated sign up page with two different layouts. One if the user is coming from the claim flow and one of them if it's a basic signup. Tested claim profile and had a discussion with Alex to improve basically the UX for the user when he's logging in and when he's trying to claim an organization. And I'll do a quick demo. So basically if you will try to claim an organization, want to keep the user here we have a countdown and the jobs. Now we are going to the top priority queue and if it's approved in that one minute the user can click View My organization. It will be redirected to the My organization instead of having a model and going to portal. 
M
Marc Munier
19:44
And. 
M
Marcello Ruja
19:47
If it's failing, I realized why to keep the user there for one minute and then just telling him it's failed. We throw the model where we say that something like our team is reviewing your request because our system can automatically match your profile with. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
20:13
I'll send you some copy for that. Marcello. 
M
Marcello Ruja
20:16
Yeah, please. 
M
Marc Munier
20:17
Yeah. 
C
Charlie Groves
20:20
And. 
M
Marcello Ruja
20:23
Also I added in madmin. 
C
Charlie Groves
20:36
Some. 
M
Marcello Ruja
20:37
Better operations for claim to organize the organization basically crud. So now you can edit and you can add the team ID and the organization ID rather than trying to search for an organization between 1 million and half or how many we have and that's it. 
M
Marc Munier
21:06
Marcello, two questions. Marcello, you just logged in as admin. 
M
Marcello Ruja
21:09
Do you not log in as Marcello, it's locally and. 
M
Marc Munier
21:14
Oh I see. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
21:14
Right, okay. 
M
Marc Munier
21:16
Right, cool. Just checking. And what was your thing? It has escaped my mind. Oh, and did you. You've updated the pages, the sign in pages. Right. So they're more friendly now in terms. 
M
Marcello Ruja
21:28
Yeah, yesterday and it's deployed and so basically live and for the rest of the day we have some problems obviously with claim profile when the user claimed the entire tree. I think we displayed the last one claim automatically. So I need to add the dropdown with all of the claimed organizations. Basically binary. 
M
Moka Varun
22:02
I'll share my screen. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
22:07
Oh, sorry, no blockers. 
M
Moka Varun
22:09
Can you see. 
M
Marc Munier
22:13
It'S coming through now. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
22:18
Your new laptop today, right? 
M
Marc Munier
22:19
Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
22:21
It may still be like video or audio access needs adjusting. 
M
Marcello Ruja
22:26
There we go now. 
M
Marc Munier
22:28
Yeah, it's concerning that Moka can't. Can't share his screen effectively. I'm sure it's. This is just a bit. Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
22:37
It'S super blurry for me. I don't know if anyone else. 
M
Marc Munier
22:39
Yeah. Oh, that's coming to you now. 
M
Moka Varun
22:43
Yeah. So yesterday I did a call with Spider for the first time, met FTMIOS and it was pretty interesting like very interactive and like idea sharing discussions that we had and after. Before that I had one one with Alex as well. Gave a little bit more walkthrough to the stuff that we are doing and talked a little bit more about the platform and then Veronica gave me my first assignment which I'll be doing today. It's about entity resolution for Takeda and that was pretty much the main meetings and after that I had the other work. So today is pretty much like I'm going to spend time on learning more stuff and like doing the Takeda assignment. So yeah, that's basically my stand up. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
23:31
Any stuck points? But do you have any stuck points? That's the last question to answer anytime you do a stand up. 
M
Moka Varun
23:38
Okay, nothing as of now. I didn't get time yesterday so I have more time today so I will go through that. So as of now, nothing. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
23:48
Okay, let me know if you have any issues that you need to discuss especially with resolution because that's quite a tricky bit of our overall business. Yeah. 
C
Charlie Groves
23:58
Cool. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
23:59
Yesterday so delivered the kind of Excel based maturity model for SAP which was a very long arduous process because their. Their Requirements are slightly different than what our platform supports. So for everyone's benefit they only wanted to use emission factors that are 23, 2023 or more recent. So we had to filter those out. We had to match assurances as well because they only wanted to use emission backers limited assurance. So got that done. Thanks Charlie for the help on fixing the bug or really just the inefficiency with how we export that. I think they'll be quite happy with this. And again this is exactly what the maturity module that we want to build next is designed to kind of enable in the platform instead of in Excel. So very excited for that otherwise. Mocha, already mentioned the call we had. 
M
Marc Munier
24:56
Yes. Just on the SAP thing. Is there anything you can just screenshot. I'd be really interested just to sort of see it. I think that I want to make sure that the engineering team are fully aware of sort of like, you know, these are the things that really our customers are asking for because you may touch this functionality in some way, shape or form. Let's just take a minute just to get the guys. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
25:15
Yeah, they have shared this already but not the finished version. So here's kind of what they're looking for is a clear. So they have 300 suppliers, what's the next step? And the next step towards SAP's goal of having all 300 of these suppliers have an emission factor. So what should they do? And they would like to get to full 100% organization emission factor coverage. So really you can see here their criteria. This is kind of the end goal. Use the emission factor that's available and how do we get to that is they have a 2024 emission factor. In the case of Microsoft they have limited assurance across all three scopes. So from their point of view this is good to use and so that's great. There is a step back from that. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
26:03
So open text, for example, they have a 2024 emission factor but they didn't get assurance for this year. And so the next step would be to ask for an assurance statement. Now this one I personally checked, they explicitly say we didn't get assurance on this data. And so what SAP will do probably is say hey, we'd love for you to get assurance next year. And so it's moving the supplier down that maturity funnel towards something that SAP can use in their own reporting. Let's take another example of Oracle. So request relevant categories for recent year. So this is an interesting case. Oracle had an admission factor in 2020, then they stopped reporting category data and so that means that SAP will not use their emission factor even though we have one, because it's not recent enough. 
A

Now on the more recent one they're missing a couple categories. So we show them what categories were missing for Oracle in order for Oracle to have that in 2024. Now maybe Oracle already has that data and they just didn't break it out. And so we have a claim profile link here for Oracle that SAP could say, hey, can you just go ahead and send us your category data here and they can update it by the claim profile. So every claim profile is here. Now let's see any others request relevant categories. I think this one is they didn't have an admission factor because they were missing these categories. So that would be the next step. And in some cases you have a few that are in waiting. So we say confirm the entity, we need more information. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
27:38
And in a few cases we have 2025 emission factors coming. So it's like they'll have an emission factor as soon as we get 2025 added to our exports. Some of them have not disclosed and so the first step is just ask them to disclose and they can do so via this claim link. So all these actions are pushing the suppliers to go to ditchcarbon upload what you have and let's move you a step forward. In the funnel we want to visualize this in the web app. So this should be something that in the spec for the improve organization maturity is such that SAP can define what their funnel is. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
28:17
So the end goal being emission vector with assurance across scope one through three and then they can define what are these segments that lead up to that and then visualize that in our web app and see that changing over time and actually trigger the claim profile to be sent to the suppliers with a message that we would like to see you get assurance on your scope three because you don't have that right now according to that. And so that would be the next step is the supplier that has claimed their profile can see SAP has asked you for this specific thing that's in their supplierity maturity module. Click here to upload it. So again, going back to. We're building a network, a platform, no longer Just a SaaS tool. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
29:04

And I think this is the kind of we're just going to make it as easy as possible for people to share data, to know what, how they're being evaluated, to know what they're missing. That's the goal of that product Bloomberg of carbon emissions data. Exactly. 
M
Marc Munier
29:19
That was about four years ago. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
29:23
No, but it's true because one thing that people don't realize Bloomberg for financial data, it is their moat is really that people have the data in front of them and then they're messaging their partners, they're messaging their colleagues around the data. And the messaging is actually what makes it impossible for anyone to get rid of Bloomberg because lots of companies have the financial data now, but they don't have the network that Bloomberg has. So that's what we're trying to build. So that was interesting to show Pfizer we talked through this and he actually FDMios, our key, one of our key POCs at Pfizer gave us a suggestion that he loves the organization forecast. He wants every category manager to be showing off the organization forecast and recommendations to suppliers in their annual business reviews. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
30:09
And he gave a suggestion that the supplier should be able to add a comment or maybe fill out a very simple question of like do you think this organization forecast is credible? Do you think that you're on track to match this or do you think that you will be ahead of it or behind it? So give some extra context and if the organization has claimed their profile and add that context to for example the forecast, any company that is looking at them as a supplier would be able to see that. And so that is one way to again create user generated content on top of the data that we already have and we're serving up product. So film the claim flow here for our users specifically targeting someone like Pfizer or Coherent that is already a customer of Dig Carbon. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
30:56
Here's how you use it. I think there's a separate video that we need to produce for just any company that finds their profile on Ditch Carbon that wants to take control of it. So kind of the supplier view versus the buyer view. So that was yesterday. Today I'm going to be very much focused on getting stuff sorted out with a claim flow with Marcello in particular, sending that out to all of our customers, getting a supplier facing video filmed. I think the launch is my number one priority today. Let's see. Anything else? Couple of bug tickets. We'll, we'll get started on updating a file for coherent, their 2026 Q1 data. So setting next steps for that and then I'll be running payroll. Any. No, no stuck points for me. Anything else on standup before we move over to Sprint Retro? 
M
Marc Munier
31:51
I can do a two minute update because I'm here sort of thing. I don't want to be left out. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
31:54
Oh yeah, sorry. Jesus. 
M
Marc Munier
32:00
So yeah, I was in person with Max yesterday it was nice did a really interesting pitch to 3i. So three are a private equity firm. This is their infrastructure division which is actually a relatively small part of their overall business. What was very interesting about it is that they wanted to recommend us to their portfolio businesses and that's a really nice place to because it's if your investor tells you should use this unless it's going to hurt you're going to do it because everybody wants to keep investors happy. So that was great. I wrote a bunch of blogs and then I built out a whole sort of sequence around targeting private equity firms, of which there are many with this sort of pitched Sandoz. They are a pharmaceutical supplier. Been trying to get in there for ages and there are. 
M
Marc Munier
32:43
Something's changed. What was really interesting is that the main contact there, Lucy has she implemented watershed in her previous company and her company before that she implemented manufacture 2030 and as a result she is deeply skeptical of climate tech because they basically massively over promised to her. And so our approach of I said to her look, this is the demo. Access it, do whatever you like with it's yours. She goes, wow, that's really generous of you. Sometimes it's hard even to get a demo, you know, let alone with our own data and then giving us access to it. Okay with the price. She was okay with it. Really sort of nice get sent a loom to iwg. 
M
Marc Munier
33:25
They wanted to see their own public profile which was interesting because part of his argument for investing as us is that they look shit publicly because they haven't measured their scope 3 so another really interesting sort of use case there trying to get AWS to sort of work and a couple of meetings with Salesforce Net Zero Cloud, few different contacts. We're quite deeply embedded in that now. So that's good. No stack points. I'm supposed to be off today so I'll probably be leaving after this spin. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
33:56
Retro, any questions? No, no questions. Actually one question. Do you need any more technical support on getting the AWS stuff set up for Ken who? Or can we close that out? 
M
Marc Munier
34:08
We can close that out. We. Yeah, we can close that out. I We need to sort out some permissions thing that Charlie's been helping me with but it's that particular ticket can be closed. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
34:18
Okay, sounds good. All right then I want to shift gears to Sprint Retro. So as I said before from Mocus Benefit, very simple. What went well? What are we happy with for this Sprint? What could have gone better? What would we like to improve and Then tactically, what should we do, you know, before end of day kick off processing over the weekend? So we come into Monday and everything looks good and so why don't we go over to Grup first? 
G
Gourav Sen
34:47
Yeah, from my side. 
C
Charlie Groves
34:50
Charlie, sorry, before we go into that, could you click on that link? This one I just want to show. Yeah. Before we get into it, all of the tickets that were closed. This Sprint, if you scroll down there are like 30 or 40. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
35:05
Yeah, it's always good when you have to click the load more. 
M
Marc Munier
35:09
Yeah, yeah. 
M
Marc Munier
35:10
That's a measure of a successful Sprint, I think. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
35:16
Yeah, grab, Go ahead. 
G
Gourav Sen
35:18
Yeah, same from. From my side as well. We delivered a lot of tickets this time, so it was a very good Sprint and we did some optimization as well. So the organizations and the documentages are loading up much faster than before. I would say more than 30 or 40% of speed improvement in terms of that. And there was some code improvements as well. And the pipeline is running more smoothly now, so it's really helpful. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
35:48
This is very noticeable, by the way, just observing yesterday. I think there are still some documents and organizations that are kind of stuck in a limbo from a few weeks ago. Charlie, I think you mentioned there's like a ghost of some bug that we already fixed. I did notice that when delivering for SAP in like three or four cases. So I could probably dig them up if we're not aware of that. But in general for new jobs, it seems to be flowing quite quickly. Hopefully we're seeing that same kind of feedback from the hit as well when he's using this. But I personally noticed a significant improvement the last day or so. Cool. Marcello. Okay. 
M
Marcello Ruja
36:33
So I think once. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
36:36
Sorry. 
M
Marcello Ruja
36:37
So I think one print with one feature, it's good. I mean, it sounds good for me. Then Claim Profile, honestly, I can see people, how it's people using Claim Profile, uploading documents and maybe in the future discussing with their organization, I would say. And Also we have 7057 users which confirmed their email already. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
37:12
That's it. Charlie. 
C
Charlie Groves
37:17
Yeah, I fixed a lot of stuff and I think we're in a really good place in terms of infrastructure and in terms of bugs. So we found the optimal database like CPU amount we need, which allows us to process the data we need to process at the speed we need to do it without slowing down research or the web app, which is a very nice steady state. So before were on like maybe six times higher than were now, which was great because we could do whatever we wanted, but it costs a lot of Money now it's only one above, like the smallest one, and we're sitting pretty consistently at 50% usage, which gives us a good amount of headroom in if we do need to turn on the turbos. But it means everything just kind of works a bit better. 
C
Charlie Groves
38:07
Then I've highlighted five main bugs that I fixed this sprint here, all of which were pretty bad bugs but are all resolved now, which is very nice. And I have points on this in the gaps in areas for improvement as well. I made an architectural change to how documents and organizations interact, which has made Mahit's team happy. The system is now responsive to their changes almost immediately, whereas before it could take a few hours. So that's nice and I like seeing all of the performance optimizations go out. So I've done some of the sprint grabs, done quite a lot this sprint and this means that the amount of unnecessary work we're doing is massively reduced. 
C
Charlie Groves
38:51
So for example, the one that Gaurav opened a pull request for today, we used to recalculate every client org and therefore every project and forecast every time an organization's data would update or sorry, every time an organization would recalculate, which doesn't necessarily mean its data is updated. So imagine Apple 2000ish client orgs. There's a massive fan out operation that happens there. We're now no longer doing that if the data hasn't changed, which is such an obvious optimal optimization. But it's really nice, speeds everything up. It's like adding oil on the gears. 
M
Marc Munier
39:28
What impact that will have on our compute and everything then. Charlie, what percentage of our effort was that do you think that Gurav's solved? 
C
Charlie Groves
39:37
Maybe 15 or 20%. But it's more so when we have to reprocess loads of stuff. The long tail of that processing will be significantly shorter. 
M
Marc Munier
39:48
And we haven't yet done the work to do the manual refresh, have we? 
C
Charlie Groves
39:53
So the refresh is working slower in the background already. So if you haven't noticed it looking broken, then it's working quite well. But no, we still need to add the button. 
M
Marc Munier
40:05
When did that get done? 
C
Charlie Groves
40:08
Sometime last week. 
M
Marc Munier
40:11
Great job, guys. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
40:12
It's not been broken, it's been fine. 
M
Marc Munier
40:14
Yeah, totally. 
M
Marc Munier
40:15
Yeah, yeah. 
M
Marc Munier
40:15
I just want just kudos to Gurav and yourself there. Like, yeah, very nice. Just if you can increase efficiency and nobody notices, that's the best type, isn't it? Right? You know, like that's the, that's the best way of doing it. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
40:29
So nice work yeah, this is good. My feeling was that Mahit was kind of. His team was almost on strike for a little while because they're like, it's not even worth our time to log in. Like, like, you know. So thank you for fixing that so they can actually make progress. Good. Mark, anything on your side that you want to share for things going well? 
M
Marc Munier
40:49
I mean, yeah, just to reiterate, really just like claim profiles out there. Like we have been trying to do that for a year, right? Literally a year. I had a coffee with someone that used to run a big UX agency. I was like, dude, he's like, what you don't have is like this user. People worry about user loops but what you need to focus on more is sort of like use loops so reasons for people to come back to the platform and we've just been trying to do it for so long and I'm just so pleased that Marcello's the guy that did it because, you know, without embarrassing him. I don't think you knew Rails when you joined so like it's quite. 
M
Marc Munier
41:28
Yeah, yeah. 
M
Marc Munier
41:29

You sort of accelerated your capability like an ungodly sort of rate. So, you know, so yeah, just wanted to. Kudos for that. Very pleased about that. Also we got the chatbot out and we also made some significant cost savings on GCP as well. I mean obviously Charlie, but the. What else have we done that's been. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
41:54
I'll cover Pfizer because I think that was a big one. 
M
Marc Munier
41:57
Oh yeah, Pfizer was good. But also the. All the. We constantly are doing like updates on the marketing site and I know that you guys have to do some work to keep it as live as well. And you may not have seen it, but in the marketing channel we're assigned to rank really well now for Scope three tools, which we didn't literally a month ago. So. Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
42:16

Cool. That all went well. Yeah. I would say for me, the. The claim profile, it's like as Mark said, literally been a year in the making. It also just feels like tangibly the platform actually works now. Right. Like when I would say a sprint ago, my feeling was when we need to deliver something for customers, it's like, well, I better buffer like 2 to 3x the time that I need because something's going to break, it's going to be going very slowly and I would say that my feeling now as of the last few days is that it's much smoother and we've dealt with a of lot of the underlying problems. So I hope to be bugging the dev team, much less going forward. So that's a huge relief. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
42:59
And then finally Pfizer, like, I just think we have really hit our stride working with them to the point where it's very exciting to feel like we are an advisor that's on their side of the table, like helping them to do something pretty momentous. And I mean, you guys may not realize, but Pfizer might be one of the top three most influential pharma companies globally. So what they do really matters for the entire sector. And so I think that just feels like a privilege to be helping them and to feel like we're on their side and I'll just show off kind of what if the meos was asking us about here? So he basically highlighted what happened. So already claimed the profile, waiting for approval, gonna send it to two companies that we're very close with to start. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
43:53

And then he said, hey, by the way, every Pfizer member on our team got the following email. Is that how it's supposed to work to your point, Mark, about engagement loops. So this is what probably 90 people at Pfizer received today is. Hey, your colleague of Femios just claimed Pfizer. Check it out here. So needless to say, I want to get all the kinks worked out in the claim flow because that is really exciting to have those kind of reactivation loops. So when we think about engagement with our users and how are we going to get them back into the platform? What I'd like to do is give users the ability to see notifications like this, maybe daily, maybe weekly, as a summary of your suppliers have done this, right. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
44:41
And your team member just assigned you a task and that's how we turn into a Scope three tool that they're using all day, every day. So very excited about that. Anything else on the kind of highlights before we go to gaps areas for improvement? Mocha, I would be remiss not to. To ask you actually. 
M
Moka Varun
45:03
Actually, yeah. So yesterday when we had with Pfizer, right, like FTM gave lot of recommendations like how we can improve the interactive dashboard. Also, like, how do you like, you know, incorporate those ideas? Because you will have so many ideas coming from different projects with different customers. 
C
Charlie Groves
45:23
Right. 
M
Moka Varun
45:23
How do you kind of like, you know, handle and plan them and like give priorities to what is more important in terms of development. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
45:32
It's a good question. I was actually asking for you to share in terms of what went well for you in your first week, but I'll answer your question first and then pass it Back to you, just real briefly. We ask customers to give us feedback all the time and if we think it's a good idea, we like to build it really quickly. And I think that encourages them to give us more feedback. So we've done that numerous times for Pfizer and so that's why he's giving us feedback. As KC knows, we'll actually use it. And so then the way we prioritize it is basically anything that Pfizer is asking us for, we just have to ask, is this something that every other big enterprise or many big enterprises would want? Yes. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
46:12
Then we'll definitely put it in the roadmap and the question is just when? And that's a strategic question. But we'll definitely build something if Pfizer is asking for it or Coherent is asking for it and we feel something that everyone else will want and it's just. Yeah, can I just. Beauty of enterprise software is that we don't need to guess what they want. They will tell us. 
M
Marc Munier
46:32
I just. Just chip back to Pfizer just for a second. Just to give you guys, like, by the way, we've got this great GPT, I called it Cam, the carbon equivalent calculator. All my custom GPTs are named after people. So what this does. And anyone can access this. Where's my other GPTs? These are all the ones I've got. Maria, the Mauritian, Sabri, the supplier list, Lucy, the list curates. Yeah, lots of them anyway. So you can put in any number in and it will give you an equivalence and give you an idea. 
C
Charlie Groves
47:00
Right? 
M
Marc Munier
47:01
So I've just put in 2.8 million billion kilograms of carbon, which is Pfizer's scope three emissions, right? And so the work that we're doing with them quite beyond the sort of the influential stuff that Alex was just sort of talking about, this is equivalent to flying 5 million people to London, between London and New York, right? This is the equivalent to giving everyone a T shirt in. In France ten times over. Like. So if you're thinking about, like, if you. I think everyone here genuinely cares about trying to address the climate crisis, right? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
47:37
But. 
M
Marc Munier
47:37
But if you think about the sort of, the personal choices that you make, those are important, but the work that you're doing is directly impacting this at an enormous scale. And so I just, you know, I just like to remind ourselves of that every now and then. But this is like, you know, when people ask you what you do, our work is software, but, you know, what you're really doing is like, you know, Genuinely impacting, you know, making a dent in this, these sort of big numbers. So anyway, I just wanted to share that I'm in a philosophical mood today, but check out Cam, the carbon calculator on. I can say to share the GPT with you and if you need it. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
48:09
All right, thanks. 
M
Marc Munier
48:11
Cool. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
48:13
Mocha highlights this week. 
M
Moka Varun
48:17
Pretty interesting and very intense as well because of my other stuff. But like I. The calls with like shadowing the calls with the customers kind of helped me a lot. Like I learned a lot from those calls and so far my interactions have only been with you, Alex, not with other people. So I'm looking forward to that and I'm excited to learn more about the tech as well. So this week has been intense. I've been doing two jobs, but I'm happy. This is the most amount of money I've earned in a long time. So that's a good side of it. But yeah, I'm excited to start fresh from next week as well. 
C
Charlie Groves
48:54
So. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
48:54
Yeah. 
C
Charlie Groves
48:54
Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
48:55
How is the Chinese restaurant going to survive without you? I don't know. 
M
Moka Varun
48:58
I don't know. Yesterday we had a guy who supposed to be my replacement and then I got a call at like 6 o'. Clock. She's like, my chef was like, I'm not able to handle him. Can you please come and help him? Like, you know, do the stuff because those. It's very intense sometimes. So yeah, hopefully we'll find a replacement soon and then. Yeah, I can chill. 
M
Marc Munier
49:19
I really want Chinese food now. 
M
Moka Varun
49:23
You should go for it. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
49:26
All right, so gaps, areas for improvement. Over to Gaurav first. 
G
Gourav Sen
49:31
Yeah, it's about the documentary processing, like mood themes, mind MPCs, issues like for the organization and document status, they are not properly seen. Sometimes something is missing and they used to revert to created or error. So there's a lot on back and forth on this. So we need to find a way to fix this problem. 
C
Charlie Groves
49:56
Yes, yes, I think this is an excellent point. Me and Alex were discussing it on Wednesday. We have like a vacuum cleaner which runs in the background at the moment, which does basically what an engineer would do to help Mahit's team if they're stuck with something. So we can turn up the speed of that and we can get like the stuck state count down to zero. But basically every instance of something not being in a terminal state is generally a bug. So there are like the cleanup operation you did on the Org pipeline today that will help significantly because it reduces the complexity of the stuff happening there and it eliminates a bug that was present. There are same changes we can make in like the document pipeline for example, as well. So yeah, definitely a focus point for next Sprint. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
50:54
Agreed. Marcello. 
M
Moka Varun
50:59
Yes. 
M
Marcello Ruja
51:00
So since I work on claim profile, I think we need a. We need to be much faster for code reviews because for example, I had a podcast request open and for five days or something like that, and I had to resolve the conflicts and which take, I. I don't know, maybe 30 minutes, one hour. Depends on the. How hard is to resolve that conflict, which can slow down the speed of implementing any feature. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
51:30
Makes sense. And especially if we're trying to ship a feature per, like a major feature per Sprint. Unacceptable. I think this would be a good one to come back to in terms of how we improve on that, especially in our new era, you know, Right. Where the three of you are the three, you know, devs on the team. Let's come back to that one in a moment. Charlie. 
C
Charlie Groves
51:52
Yeah, I should have made the architectural change I made this week a lot sooner. I proposed. So this is specifically with how documents tell organizations that they're ready to recalculate. I proposed it a few months ago and I don't think I did the best job of explaining why it was so important so I could do a better job with stuff like that. And evidently the Sprint there's no monitoring on errored records. So we had 4,000 error orgs, the wall erroring because of the same reason. And there was a pretty easy code fix. And what you get when that happens is basically an infinite calculation loop because it goes from created to errored and then it just loops, does that loop over and over again. 
C
Charlie Groves
52:41
So we need a dashboard in Grafana which monitors the errors in the pipelines, and we need that to send a notification to Slack when we see a spike, because then we can pretty easily resolve them because generally they're not difficult issues. And the system is telling us when it's broken, we're just not listening to it. And there are issues with document. Org resolution, which I'm currently working on. But my point here is again, how could we have caught this sooner, like proactively? I believe that a problem of a similar nature will happen again in the future. The future maybe not this exact problem, but I feel like again, we can learn from it and put monitoring in place for maybe like the average number of orgs trying to claim a document. 
C
Charlie Groves
53:29
Or if, like, if we see spikes in like the number of orgs on the document over three, then that's a warning sign that something is coming. Yeah, that's I have something to say on the code review thing as well, if you want to go into that. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
53:42
Yeah, yeah, no, I would Just let me share mine real quick, Mark and Mocha and then we'll go back to code review. I think my main point also, even though I didn't write it down, would be what Charlie was saying, but on the reverse side. So I would say typically how we catch bugs is, you know, Veronica or Mocha or I will be very close to the system. We'll be using it, or Max will be using it or Mark will be using it. We notice that something's wrong and we escalate it. And I think we're doing a good job of escalating and then fixing things quickly. I would like us to move to a state where the dev team knows proactively when something is going wrong even before we see it. 
M
Moka Varun
54:22
Right. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
54:23
Because I think the major issues that Charlie highlighted. We fixed this sprint. It's clear that they didn't. It's not like we broke something last sprint and then we're fixing it. This sprint, they've actually been hanging around for who knows how long. And so we just weren't aware of them until we started to hit a critical mass where the problem was kind of impossible to avoid. And were definitely going to notice it. And so I think just proactively understanding when things are breaking, it's just we're at the stage where that's what the company needs to do. Totally agree. Mark, over to you. Or let's go. Mocha first and then Mark, anything that could have been better. This Sprint. 
M
Moka Varun
55:03
Pardon? Hello? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
55:07
Yeah. You're good. 
M
Moka Varun
55:08
I know. I didn't understand, like, what do you want me to tell, like. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
55:11
Yeah, so in this section, we're talking about what were the things that we could have done better? What were the areas that we could improve on for next time? So anything that could have gone better in your first week? 
M

I mean, for me, everything was pretty good. Like, in terms of improvement, I mean, I would say, I think in terms of knowledge base. Like, there's a lot of content on notion. Like when I have to consume. Right. Because I have to learn about each and every department's work. So I was thinking, say, for example, if we. Even if you're going to have more people in the future, is it possible to have a kind of like, you know, a guide set that we can provide them to get through everything so that you have some kind of, like, you know, overview of each and everybody's work? So if that's Possible. Like, you know, that would be kind of helpful, not only for me, but for future also. 
C
Charlie Groves
56:09
Yeah. 
M
Moka Varun
56:12
So that is, like, just a point. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
56:13
That I wanted to thank you. 
M
Marc Munier
56:15
So the team directory needs. Is not really being kept up to date, has it? So we need to sort of work on that. That's what. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
56:21
That's what that option is. 
C
Charlie Groves
56:23
Yeah. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
56:24
Yeah. Mark, how about you? I think I give this feedback quite. 
M
Marc Munier
56:32
Regularly, but I think just like, you know, just shouting about the successes that we're doing, you know, like we are. We have made an enormous sort of progress in the last couple of weeks. And you guys have been working your asses off, you know, just sort of make sure everyone knows about it. Yeah, I haven't got any. Any particular complaints. I would say I think it's gone pretty well. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
56:55
Let's go back to this point then, because this is quite tactically important, I would say transitioning into next Sprint. So how should we. I think there are two things that we should discuss before we sign off from this call. At least have a rough idea for the dev team. So one is pull request reviews and then kind of merging to pushing to prod. Right. So those two things. How should we update those would be the question. So we can be more efficient so that we're not slowing down our sprint, which clearly happened. 
C
Charlie Groves
57:33
Yeah. So generally it's the engineers responsibility to get their code reviewed. So what I see Marcello do is like, if he's put a pull request in engineering and no one's looked at it for a day, he'll then send it again, be like, hey, this needs a review, which is great. It would also be good if we had a standardized. Like, if a pull request is open, it must be reviewed within a day, and if it needs to be faster than that, then ping someone directly on Slack. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
58:06
Okay. 
C
Charlie Groves
58:07
Generally, smaller pull requests get reviewed faster because it's easier to review. There's less complexity. If I see a large pull request, I have to sit down for maybe 20 minutes, read the code, understand what's happening, understand the side effects, and I might not have time to do that day. Then I have to wait till the next day. Whereas smaller pull requests, I can read the code in five minutes and know whether it's good or not. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
58:32

So what's the takeaway there, Charlie? Is it two to do more small pull requests instead of one big one? 
M
Marc Munier
58:38
Exactly. 
M
Moka Varun
58:39
Yeah. 
C
Charlie Groves
58:39
That's my preferred way of developing anyway. I think it helps with momentum. 
M
Marc Munier
58:45
I like. I like Guru's idea that you just put in the chat. I think I think you should just tag somebody when you do it, because it's that classic thing if, like, in an emergency situation, you're supposed to say, you go call an ambulance. You go get some towels. Where if you say, somebody help me, everyone thinks somebody else is going to do it. And I think that's probably the situation that we're in here, is that somebody else will pick it up. So I think maybe just do it on a round robin vaguely in your minds, right? So just be like, well, Charlie, I'm gonna do a pull request. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
59:12
I want to review. 
M
Marc Munier
59:13
I'm gonna do Gaurav, and then just be. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
59:16
I like this idea, Mark, but can we maybe even structure it a bit more? Like, can there be a day of the week where, like, Gurav is on pull request? 
M
Marc Munier
59:24
Then you gotta remember, haven't you? I just think you just tag the next person because it's only between two people. Don't forget. So it's either. If I'm Charlie, it's either Guru or Marcello. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
59:34
And so I've got a tag. Okay, so you're saying just go every other. Yeah, I mean, I hear what the. What would work best for the devs, but yeah. Charlie, what do you think? 
C
Charlie Groves
59:43
So I would recommend requesting a review from the person you think would be most knowledgeable on the code you're pushing. So if I'm making a change to front end stuff to claim profile, to forecast recommendations, anything like that, I'd probably request Marcello. If I'm making back end changes to the code complex stuff with. With jobs and pipeline changes, I probably request grav. Both of them are equally competent at reviewing both of them. But I think that just makes the decision easier of who to request. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:00:16
So, Charlie, are you going to end up reviewing their. Both of them and every pull request? Because I think they would objectively say you're the most knowledgeable person about everything, which is fair, you know, and so that you wish for. 
M
Marc Munier
01:00:32
By mixing it up, you get, you know, it's not quite as efficient. But what it does mean is the grove gets more exposure to front end and Marcello gets more exposure to back end. 
C
Charlie Groves
01:00:41
Right. 
M
Marc Munier
01:00:44
It's up to the engineers. But, like, that's what I would say. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:00:47
Well, yeah. Mocha. Before you. Before you share, I'd like to hear feedback on what Marcello and Gaurav would think in this respect for you guys. 
G
Gourav Sen
01:00:57
I would say we can definitely choose someone better. Like, we all three know who knows what things better. So the nomination can be based on that. And we might. We should tag someone to review, like maybe me. Let's say I'm. I'm pushing up something so I can maybe tag Marcelo and Charlie so that they can know they have something to deliver. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:01:21
Okay, Marcello, any other thoughts here? 
M
Marcello Ruja
01:01:25
Oh, I think that's good. So small pull request and nominate someone. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:01:31
Okay, so just nominate someone. You guys can come up with the logic for how you do that, Charlie. 
C
Charlie Groves
01:01:39
So what we can do this time in two weeks is pull the average time for code review over that sprint and see if these changes have actually made an improvement. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:01:52
I like it. Okay. I think that makes sense. 
M
Marcello Ruja
01:01:59
The. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:02:00
The second kind of topic that I think that we should come to an agreement on is somewhat similar to this. But I know that Cam was basically managing deploys and the way he kind of explained that to me was like, you guys would be running each other over because everyone was trying to deploy all the time. And you make. You basically make small changes that can impact each other's work. And so I think that's also something that we should at least consider. We. Maybe that's potentially a separate conversation depending on how media it is. But what do you. What do you guys think is a starting point for that topic? 
C
Charlie Groves
01:02:36
I think we should keep the status quo, if we can, with weekly deploys, and I'm happy to handle them on a Tuesday instead of camp. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:02:46
Makes sense. Marcelo Gaurav, any addition feedback to that? 
M
Marcello Ruja
01:02:54
I think only addition here is that if it's a emergency full request, I think we can do another deploy rather. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:03:04
Than only one P. 
C
Charlie Groves
01:03:08
Yeah, the status. The status quo at the moment I think has been if it's a P0 bug, then we'll deploy to get it fixed. And I think, yeah, I agree much on it. We should keep. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:03:18
That makes sense. 
M
Marc Munier
01:03:20

I don't understand it fully, but when you're doing a deploy, is it worth having, doing, maybe even doing it together? So the whole process is again, just sort of expanding the knowledge, understanding. Okay. You know, I don't know if you're doing it at a specific time on a Tuesday. Just have a standing meeting in the diary. Yeah. Just doing shito stand up. I think just taking a bit of time, getting everyone really familiar. I think it's a good thing. 
M
Marcello Ruja
01:03:50
Also, I don't know if it's a good idea or not. We can do like a bug bash after the deploy for 10 minutes maybe in the stand up to test what we just implemented. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:04:02
I like that. Great idea. 
M
Marc Munier
01:04:04
Yeah. Loving that. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:04:09
Yeah. Because we're never going to be thinking about it as much as we do right when we deploy it. So yeah, just get the bugs fixed immediately before customers are telling us about them. 
C
Charlie Groves
01:04:20
Love it. 
M
Marc Munier
01:04:21
Yeah, really good. 
M
Marc Munier
01:04:22
Great attitude. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:04:25
Cool. Anything else here that you want to add? Grav anyone else in terms of how we should handle that? Okay, sounds good. Mocha, did you have anything else you wanted to add there? 
S
Sunny Hsiao
01:04:39
I just had a question. 
M
Moka Varun
01:04:41
We're talking about code review and the pull request. Do we use any kind of agentic flow in the process? Like for the code review? Like do you use any like customized agents? Like anything. I just want to know about it. 
M
Marc Munier
01:04:54
That's it. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:04:54
Like yeah, I would say follow up. Let's. Let's parking lot that one. Follow up in the engineering chat. And I'm sure that you provide you some documentation also a good topic for one ones next week. 
C
Charlie Groves
01:05:05
Yeah, sure. 
M
Marc Munier
01:05:07
And it's actually there's no reason why you can't join with deploy where you'll see it all working and everything they do anyway. 
C
Charlie Groves
01:05:12
Right. 
M
Marc Munier
01:05:12
Because we want to make sure could expand it if possible. That is a point. So I. There may be some issues with the coding tools that you guys are using because I don't have access to them to change details. So if you see weirdness, just flag it to me and we can set up a new account if we need to or whatever. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:05:29
So Mark, to be clear, so the billing is gonna bounce, right? 
M
Marc Munier
01:05:34
So yeah, because we switched off Cam's card, so. But I've been trying for the last 20 minutes to get anthropic to give me access, but they won't. So what I'm hoping is that it will fail and then maybe we'll just need to set up a new account. Yeah, that's the sort of thing. But I don't know. Like just get. Yeah. Tell me if. If it breaks and I will try and fix it, you know. So just to be clear, what tools are you using actively now and which tools would you like to continue to actively use now when it comes to engineering, AI productivity. 
C
Charlie Groves
01:06:18
Code and cursor, we. 
M
Marc Munier
01:06:21
Need both of those. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:06:21
Do we? Yeah. Yeah. 
M
Marc Munier
01:06:24
Okay, fine. And you were unable to get access to Cursor either, were you? 
C
Charlie Groves
01:06:29
So I have member access on both Cursor and Claude, but not. 
M
Marcello Ruja
01:06:35
Okay. 
C
Charlie Groves
01:06:37
Okay. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:06:39
In terms of action items. So Charlie is next steps here. Promoca's benefits. So again, what do we need to do today ideally before we sign off so that things are processing over the weekend when customers are not checking. And so when we do big reprocessing it can Cause a little bit of slowness in the platform. Things can break in a worst case scenario. So we like to do that over the weekend as opposed to when customers are using the product during the week. So Charlie, what have we got? 
C
Charlie Groves
01:07:09
Yeah, just two here to fix bugs and improve data. So depending on costs, which I'll work out, we either want to resolve every document which has more than one org claiming it, or we want to resolve the most hairy ones and maybe spread out the cost over a longer period of time. Before running any of that, I'll send a summary of how much the inference will be in engineering. And the other one is just a basic recalculation for the bug you noticed yesterday, Alex, which is now fixed because docs always tell orgs when they're ready. But cleaning that up requires a bit of recalculation, so I'll do that as well. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:07:48
Sounds good. And Charlie, I forget if this is exactly what I cited yesterday, but I saw probably three or four cases where we had orgs in synced docs in synced. There were no emission factors, but there should have been. So no missing relevant categories. Had revenue and it just looked like nothing had triggered to reprocess them. So is that the same issue or a different issue? 
C
Charlie Groves
01:08:12
That's the exact same bug manifesting in a different way. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:08:15
Okay, cool. So then let me know if you need some cases. I can think of a few off the top of my head, but sounds like you're already on it, Marcello. 
M
Marcello Ruja
01:08:26
Yes. So we've added scorecard for claim for organization. Claim for my organization page. And that means we needed to pre calculate the scorecard, the score breakdown. So we need to pre calculate for every organization our database DNA for breakout. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:08:48
Sounds good, Marcello. Related question here. What is the cash situation for the scorecard? How quickly? The reason I'm asking is because I'm wondering how quickly should the scorecard change if a user uploads new data and it's finished processing? I checked when I uploaded fake data for Ditch Carbon yesterday and the scorecard points updated immediately, but the actual score did not. And so I'm assuming that's on some lag. What is the lag that we should expect there? 
M
Marcello Ruja
01:09:24
I think I need to investigate that. Because if you say that the score so the scorecard was automatically updated, but the gouge, or gouge, I don't know how it's called this or actually score is not updated. I think it's a cache problem. Or maybe it's not updated automatically. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:09:42
Okay, let me send you the example details there. 
M
Marcello Ruja
01:09:51
But I'm going to hear that the data actually updated automatically. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:09:56
Yeah, it did. It went to synced properly. The emissions page updated properly. The scorecard was then showing we have, you know, fake data for digit carbon in 20, 23 and 24, as I would expect. So the only thing that didn't update was the score and the benchmark. 
M
Marc Munier
01:10:14

That's pretty cool. Yeah, because I meant to say I asked Marcello to put some fake numbers in the meantime. So you. You've over written those with different fake numbers? 
C
Charlie Groves
01:10:24
Yes, that's. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:10:26
See the other thing I'll just remind right now is that because I uploaded a document directly, the URLs are broken, so there's basically nothing there as a source. And I think that we should be providing the. The Dig Carbon hosted source URL there. So I'll give you some instructions. I think that's like a simple thing to change. It's just a dis. Okay. Anything else in terms of weekend reprocessing? Anything on your side, Gaurav? 
G
Gourav Sen
01:11:07
Nothing. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:11:10
Okay. I think my view, Marcello, on getting the claim profile shipped is we should work together for the rest of your day to day on getting any of the bugs that were or the small UI improvements that we talked about clarified. Ideally we can. I don't know if we deploy today or early next week, but I don't think I'm going to send announcement to our users until those small things are improved and then we can actually launch it. So that's my current thought. I will work on some videos in the meantime and we can work on getting the UI improvements done. All right, Anything else before we wrap up here? 
M
Moka Varun
01:11:58
Are you. 
M
Marcello Ruja
01:12:01
Are you available after this meeting to have a father to discuss few things? 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:12:06
Let me double check. 
M
Marc Munier
01:12:08
I need you for two minutes directly after this, Alex, and then. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:12:11
Sure, sure. Yeah. So we'll be good at like let's say the half hour mark Marcello will be good. 
M
Marc Munier
01:12:16
Yeah. Just to wrap, guys, thank you so much for your continued professionalism and hard work. I know this can be an unsettling time, so if you have any questions, any concerns, let us know. But hopefully it's opportunity for you all to sort of gain more responsibility, do more interesting work, have more impact. But yeah, thank you. I'm very much looking forward to the weekend. I hope you all are too. 
A
Alex Rudnicki
01:12:43
Thank you. Good. All right, have a good weekend, everyone. Cheers. Bye. 
M
Marc Munier
01:12:46
Bye. 
C
Charlie Groves
01:12:47

Bye, guys. 
M
Moka Varun
01:12:47
Have a.
