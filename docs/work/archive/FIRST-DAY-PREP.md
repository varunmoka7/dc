### Draft Introduction

"Hi everyone, I'm Varun Moka, the new Scope 3 Support Executive. I'm based in Berlin and joining the team starting today.

**Background:** I come from a background in [your relevant experience - data analysis/project management/sustainability/etc.]. Most recently, I [brief description of last role]. Throughout my career, I've developed a strong passion for data-driven decision-making and helping organizations solve complex problems at scale.

**Why DitchCarbon:** I was drawn to DitchCarbon because Scope 3 emissions are the biggest blind spot for most enterprises - they account for 60% of emissions but companies struggle to even measure them. DitchCarbon's AI-powered platform is genuinely solving this, and I'm excited to be on the front lines helping our customers turn data into action.

**What I'm Excited About:** I'm looking forward to diving deep into emissions analysis, working directly with customers to unlock insights in their supply chains, and contributing to both our customer success and product roadmap. I'm a quick learner and genuinely curious about everything - so please don't hesitate to point me to resources or answer questions as I ramp up.

**Let's Connect:** I'm here to support the team and our customers. Looking forward to working with all of you!"
