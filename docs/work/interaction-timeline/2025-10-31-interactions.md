## Key Learnings

### Team Dynamics
- Small team = communication advantage (Marc: "Don't want to get bigger and more complicated")
- Opportunity moments during transitions (everyone stepping up)
- "High impact potential" alignment requirement (Alex)

### Product Development
- Enterprise software beauty: "They tell you what they want" (Alex)
- Feature priority: If big enterprise wants it + others would want it → roadmap
- Platform network effects: "Bloomberg of carbon emissions data" (Marc from 4 years ago)
- User-generated content strategy: Suppliers commenting on forecasts

### Customer Success (Pfizer Context)
- Top 3 most influential pharma companies globally
- Every team action triggers reactivation loops (90 employees notified when Efthymios claimed)
- Building advisor relationship, not just vendor

### Engineering Culture
- Small PRs > Large PRs (faster review, less risk)
- Bug bash immediately after deploy (catch before customers)
- Monitoring proactively, not reactively
- 15-20% compute savings from smart optimization (Gourav's work)

### Impact Scale
- Pfizer Scope 3: 2.8M billion kg CO2e = 5M people flying London-NYC
- Marc: "Personal choices matter, but this work impacts enormous scale"
