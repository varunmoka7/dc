## Customer Calls

### Pfizer - Product Feature Demo & Supplier Engagement Strategy
**Time:** 3pm Berlin time
**Duration:** ~45 minutes
**Lead:** Alex Rudnicki (COO)
**Attendees (DitchCarbon):** Alex Rudnicki, Varun Moka (first Pfizer call)
**Attendees (Pfizer):** Efthymios (Sustainable Sourcing)

**Purpose:**
- Demonstrate new supplier claim profile feature (launched Oct 30)
- Discuss interactive forecast dashboard concept (Efthymios' proposal)
- Plan supplier engagement rollout strategy
- Explore monetization tiers for supplier platform access

**Key Outcomes:**
- **Claim Profile Demo:** Efthymios enthusiastic - "now it's the right time" (had wanted this feature "long ago")
- **Interactive Dashboard Proposal:** Efthymios pitched 3-4 question survey below forecast graph that adjusts trajectory in real-time
  - Suppliers can see how their investment decisions affect emissions path
  - Can export/share with leadership internally
  - Alex committed to implementation by **end of year**
- **Monetization Strategy:** Agreed free tier (scorecard, trajectory, recommendations) + paid tier (Scope 3 detail, benchmarking)
- **Sectoral Benchmarks:** Will add industry/regional expected trajectories (avoid supplier name confidentiality issues)
- **Next Steps:** Efthymios will work with Elisa on questionnaire design, test claim profile feature

**Strategic Context:**
- Efthymios = key Pfizer contact, "knows DitchCarbon best out of anyone at Pfizer" (Alex)
- Working with Fred (VP Procurement) on engagement KPIs (meeting in next few weeks)
- Pfizer goal: -25% Scope 3 reduction by 2030 via supplier engagement
- Philosophy: Avoid "survey fatigue" - make engagement simple, valuable, non-bureaucratic

**Varun's Role:**
- First customer call with Pfizer specifically (shadowing Alex)
- Contributed suggestion on peer comparison (sectoral approach adopted to address confidentiality)
- Building foundation for ongoing Pfizer relationship
