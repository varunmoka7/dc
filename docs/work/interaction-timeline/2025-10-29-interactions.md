**Duration:** ~32 minutes
**Topics:**
- Platform import challenges and formatting issues (Varun's confusion acknowledged as valid)
- Product roadmap overview (Miro board access granted)

- Q4 priorities: Platform enablement + Self-serve AI agent assistant (TOP PRIORITY)
- Organization matching system deep dive (Requested vs Matching org concept)
- Corporate hierarchy intelligence (S&P Global database, data inheritance)

- In-house matching system project (Charlie's work: 1.5M → 10-20M orgs)

**Key Outcomes:**

- Product goals framework: Quality Data → Plug & Play Scope 3 → Cash Flow Break Even → Scalable Growth
- Sprint retrospective invitation for Friday

**Context:**
- Varun's old MacBook crashing frequently (new one arriving Oct 31/Nov 1)

## Key Learnings

**From 1:1 with Alex:**
1. **Two-record system:** Requested org vs Matching org = critical for audit trail
2. **Self-serve priority:** Current UX confusing (acknowledged); AI agent solution is Q4 top priority (November)
3. **Confidence threshold:** 75%+ = auto-match, <75% = manual review
4. **Tiered customer support:** Amazon gets high-touch (manual review all), ETH Zurich lower-touch (GPT-assisted)
5. **Product goals hierarchy:** Quality before automation (Accurate + Auditable → then Automate)
6. **Cash flow focus:** Break even Q1 2026, not chasing VC funding ("default to live")
7. **Platform transformation:** Moving from SaaS tool to platform (supplier claims, maturity module)

**From Standup:**
8. **Product launch timing:** Claim profile feature ready to ship
9. **Compliance rigor:** Rejected Google's non-standard combined Scope 3 reporting
10. **Customer validation:** Denu issue showed DitchCarbon methodology superior to manual work
11. **UX improvements:** Recommendation count increased based on product feedback
