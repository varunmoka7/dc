## Week 1: October 27 - October 31, 2025

### Key Learnings

**Learning 1: The Reality of Scope 3 Data**
- Many companies don't have baseline Scope 3 measurement
- This is both pain point (hard for them) and opportunity (we solve it)
- First project is often exploratory, not optimization

**Learning 2: The Survey vs. AI Debate**
- Customers initially skeptical of AI approach
- Once explained, they prefer speed of AI to survey burden
- Frame it as "faster, more accurate, better supplier relationships"

---

### Customer Insights

**Insight 1: Regulatory Pressure is Real**
- CSRD deadline created actual urgency
- Companies scrambling to get something done by Q1 2025
- "We'll do it next year" changed to "Can you start this week?"

**Insight 2: Procurement Teams are Key**
- Often not seat at sustainability table
- DitchCarbon gives them power/voice
- Win procurement team, win deal

---

### Product Deep Dives

**Organizations API First Experience**
- Successfully queried 3 companies
- Understood response structure
- Saw how rich the data can be
- Questions for dev team:
  - Rate limits?
  - How frequently updated?
  - Can we get historical data?

---

### Best Practices

**Practice 1: Setting Customer Expectations**
- First call: Set realistic timeline
- Explain what data will be available
- Prepare for data quality questions
- DitchCarbon approach: "85-95% as accurate as surveys, but in weeks"

---

### Questions Answered
