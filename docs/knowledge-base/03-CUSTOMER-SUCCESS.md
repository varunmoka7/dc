## FAQs & How to Answer

### FAQ 1: "How accurate is your data?"

**The Question:** "Can we really trust AI instead of surveys?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"Great question. Here's how we approach this:

Primary approach: We use verified public data
- Company sustainability reports
- SEC filings
- Government databases
- Industry research

Secondary approach: AI-verified factors
- Industry benchmarks
- Peer comparisons
- Technology-enabled matching

The result is 85-95% as accurate as surveys, but delivered in weeks instead of months.

Plus, for your top suppliers, you can still get primary data later to refine estimates."
```

---

### FAQ 2: "Why not just survey our suppliers?"

**The Question:** "Wouldn't getting primary data be better?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"Good instinct. Here's the comparison:

Survey approach:
- 30-60 days to get responses
- 10-30% response rate
- Outdated data (delays in data collection)
- High cost ($50k-$200k)
- Supplier fatigue

DitchCarbon approach:
- Instant results
- 100% coverage (no non-response)
- Current data (updated continuously)
- Cost-effective
- Supplier relationships preserved

Best practice: Use DitchCarbon for initial analysis, then get primary data from your top 20% suppliers for refinement."
```

---

### FAQ 3: "We need to report by CSRD deadline"

**The Question:** "Can DitchCarbon help us meet Q1 2025 deadline?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"Absolutely. Timeline:

Week 1: Data collection & setup
Week 2-3: Initial analysis
Week 4: Report generation (GHG Protocol + CSRD aligned)
Week 5: Review & refinement
Week 6: Ready for submission

This gets you audit-ready results in 6 weeks. Most survey approaches take 12-16 weeks."
```

---

### FAQ 4: "What if our supplier isn't in your database?"

**The Question:** "We have a small supplier not in your system"

**Your Answer:**
```
"We score 1M+ companies, but not every supplier globally.

Here's how we handle this:

Option 1: Manual lookup
- We research and score them
- Takes 2-3 days
- Usually possible if they're registered anywhere

Option 2: Industry factor
- Use industry average for their sector
- Very close to actual score
- Can refine when they provide data

Option 3: Primary data
- Get them to fill short survey
- Import directly
- Becomes part of our database

Most customers find 95%+ of suppliers in database."
```

---

### FAQ 5: "How do we reduce Scope 3?"

**The Question:** "We have the data, now what?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"Great question. There are 4 main strategies:

1. SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT
   - Work with top emitters
   - Incentivize reduction
   - Share best practices
   Example: "Join our science-based targets"

2. SUPPLIER SWITCHING
   - Switch to lower-emission suppliers
   - Sometimes premium costs offset quickly
   Example: "Renewable energy provider costs less over 5 years"

3. PRODUCT SUBSTITUTION
   - Use lower-carbon materials
   - Modify design for less waste
   Example: "Switch from aluminum to recycled steel"

4. PROCESS CHANGES
   - Optimize logistics
   - Reduce waste
   - Improve efficiency
   Example: "Consolidate shipments, reduce transport"

We'll create a specific roadmap based on your biggest opportunities."
```

## Handling Objections

### Objection 1: "This is too expensive"

**Response:**
```
"I understand cost is important. Let's look at the ROI:

CSRD non-compliance: €€€€ (penalties)
Survey approach: $200k over 6 months
DitchCarbon: $X over 2 years
+ Risk reduction from early compliance
+ Competitive advantage from early action
+ Supplier efficiency gains

Plus many companies find reducing Scope 3 saves money through efficiency."
```

---

### Objection 2: "We'll do this next year"

**Response:**
```
"I get that it's not urgent today. Let me share why timing matters:

CSRD deadline: Q1 2025 (8 weeks away)
Most companies are behind
Early movers get:
- First-mover advantage with market positioning
- More time to engage suppliers
- Better SBTi positioning
- Regulatory credibility

Starting now means you're ready when deadline hits.
Starting next year means scrambling."
```

---

### Objection 3: "We're already carbon neutral"

**Response:**
```
"Great that you've thought about this. Here's why measurement still matters:

Carbon offsets are important, but investors want to see reduction, not just offsetting.

"Carbon neutral" + "Emission reduction" = strongest ESG positioning

Plus, you might find easy wins that are cheaper than offsets.

Let's measure first, then decide strategy."
```

---

## Best Practices

### Best Practice 1: Start with Top 20%

**Principle:** 80/20 rule applies to Scope 3
- Top 20% of suppliers = 80% of emissions
- Focus resources there first
- Quick wins with biggest impact

**Implementation:**
```
"Let's segment your suppliers:
- Tier 1: Top 20% by spend & emissions → Engage immediately
- Tier 2: Middle 30% → Communicate strategy
- Tier 3: Bottom 50% → Monitor with automated tools"
```

---

### Best Practice 2: Communicate Early

**Principle:** Supplier relationships matter
- Don't surprise suppliers with emissions data
- Engage them in the journey
- Make it collaborative, not punitive

**Implementation:**
```
"When rolling out Scope 3:
- Tell suppliers why you're doing this
- Frame as partnership, not judgment
- Offer support resources
- Set achievable targets together"
```

---

### Best Practice 3: Update Regularly

**Principle:** Scope 3 is dynamic
- Suppliers change
- New suppliers enter
- Performance changes
- Regulations evolve

**Implementation:**
```
"After initial implementation:
- Quarterly reviews of top suppliers
- Annual full supply chain update
- Monitor new suppliers on entry
- Adjust targets based on progress"
```
