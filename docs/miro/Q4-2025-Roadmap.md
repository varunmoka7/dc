- In-house fuzzy matching must achieve 75%+ accuracy before Kensho elimination
- Import assist agent depends on in-house matching completion

### Customer Impact Dependencies
- SOC 2 required for enterprise customer acquisition
- Self-serve enablement required for scalable growth
- Buyer/supplier collaboration requires critical mass of suppliers

### Resource Constraints
- 6 sprints to deliver 12 major initiatives
- Team capacity limitations (sprint discipline protects focus)
- Prioritization tradeoffs (can't do everything)

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Why Self-Serve is #1 Priority
1. **Biggest user pain point** (validated by Varun's Oct 30 experience)
2. **Blocks scalable growth** (manual support doesn't scale)
3. **Reduces costs** (eliminates Kensho fees + manual matching labor)
4. **Improves quality** (in-house matching more accurate than Kensho)

### Why SOC 2 is Top 5 Priority
1. **Required for enterprise deals** (Fortune 500, financial institutions)
2. **Competitive differentiation** (many competitors lack SOC 2)
3. **Revenue unlock** (enterprise segment = higher ACV)
4. **Long sales cycle** (start now for Q1 2026 deals)

### Why Fix Usability Issues is Ongoing
1. **Customer retention** (bugs drive churn)
2. **User satisfaction** (polish improves NPS)
3. **Team morale** (bugs create support burden)
4. **Quick wins** (many fixes are small effort)
