# DitchCarbon Strategic Objectives Framework

**Source:** Miro Product Roadmap Q4 2025
**Date:** October 30, 2025

## Four Core Objectives

These four strategic objectives guide all product, engineering, and business decisions at DitchCarbon. They appear as green boxes on the left sidebar of the Miro board.

---

## 1. Quality: "Accurate, Auditable, Automated"

**Priority Order:** Accuracy → Auditability → Automation

### What This Means
- **Accurate:** Data must be factually correct and reliable
- **Auditable:** Users and their auditors must be able to verify data sources and methodology
- **Automated:** Only automate after establishing accuracy and auditability

### Why This Order Matters
- Never sacrifice accuracy for convenience
- Transparency (auditability) builds trust before efficiency
- Automation is the final layer, not the foundation

### Product Impact
- Two-record system (requested org vs. matching org) supports auditability
- Clear data attribution (showing parent company data sources)
- Audit trails for all organization resolution attempts
- UL Assurance certification of methodology

---

## 2. Cashflow Breakeven: "Default Alive"

**Philosophy:** Build a sustainable, profitable business without heavy VC dependency

### What This Means
- Target: Break even by Q1 2026 (next quarter)
- Not chasing unicorn status or $10B IPO
- Everyone in company has ownership stake
- Focus on unit economics and sustainable growth

### Exit Strategy Options
1. Acquisition by strategic partner (e.g., Salesforce, S&P Global)
2. Continued profitable growth as independent company

### Business Impact
- Tech cost management (AWS S3 migration, OpenAI optimization)
- Scalable growth model (minimal advertising, low overhead)
- Team-level pricing policy development
- Resource allocation tied to customer strategic value

---

## 3. Scalable Growth Model

**Goal:** Grow efficiently without expensive overhead or advertising spend

### Key Strategies
- **Self-serve enablement:** Reduce manual onboarding and support burden
- **Platform transformation:** SaaS → Platform (supplier claims, maturity scoring)
- **Buyer/Supplier collaboration:** Network effects drive organic growth
- **Partner integrations:** Salesforce Net Zero Cloud, AWS, strategic partnerships
- **Low overhead operations:** Lean team, efficient processes

### Growth Levers
1. Product-led growth (self-serve onboarding)
2. Network effects (buyers bring suppliers, suppliers attract buyers)
3. Strategic partnerships (integration marketplace)
4. Customer success (retention > acquisition)

---

## 4. Complete Feature Set: "Plug & Play Scope 3 Tool"

**Vision:** Handle everything a user wants to do related to Scope 3 emissions

### Current State
- **Scope 3.1:** Purchased Goods & Services ✅
- **Scope 3.2:** Capital Goods ✅
- **Other Scope 3 categories:** Planned for future

### Future Vision
- Complete Scope 3 coverage (all 15 categories)
- Product/Activity Data v3 (emissions intensity calculations)
- Regional data coverage (currently MVP phase)
- Industry-specific templates and benchmarks
- Automated data collection and processing

### Product Philosophy
- Focus on most important parts first (3.1 and 3.2 = 80% of typical Scope 3)
- Build depth before breadth (master purchased goods before adding categories)
- Customer-driven prioritization (build what customers actually need)

## Decision-Making Framework

When evaluating any initiative, ask:

1. **Quality:** Does this improve accuracy, auditability, or automation (in that order)?
2. **Cashflow:** Does this move us toward break even or reduce costs?
3. **Scalable Growth:** Does this reduce manual effort or create network effects?
4. **Complete Feature Set:** Does this expand Scope 3 coverage or depth?

**Green light:** Aligns with 2+ objectives
**Yellow light:** Aligns with 1 objective, neutral on others
**Red light:** Conflicts with any objective
