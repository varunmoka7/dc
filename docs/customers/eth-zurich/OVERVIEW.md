# ETH Zürich — Customer Overview

**ACV:** £20,000
**Status:** Training Completed (Operational Phase)
**Onboarded:** September 29, 2025
**Last Update:** October 9, 2025

## Business Need

Automate supplier emissions data collection to achieve **20% Scope 3 reduction by 2030** and stay on track for **net-zero 2040**.

Replace manual surveys with real-time data to guide low-carbon purchasing and satisfy auditors.

---

## Current State

**Suppliers:** 25,000+ total, focusing on 800 key suppliers (expect ~50% of emissions)
**Scope:** Goods & Services only (120k tonnes, excluding construction)
**Baseline:** Previously ran survey with 900 suppliers, 25% response rate, now using spend-based factors

---

## What They Use DitchCarbon For

- Automated supplier emissions data collection (vs. manual surveys)
- Supplier benchmarking & performance comparison
- Carbon data integration into ERP for procurement decisions
- Forecasting & scenario analysis (will supplier mix hit 2030 targets?)
- Audit-ready reporting & data traceability

---

## Key Features Active

- Monitor (track supplier emissions)
- Calculate (Scope 1, 2, 3 calculations)
- Org Page (supplier profiles with emissions, documents, forecast, scorecard)
- Reduce (action planning & recommendations)

---

## Current Challenges

**Data Quality:**
- Manual surveys had low yield (25% response)
- Industry factors have 10-40% error rate
- Fragmented spreadsheet data

**Supplier Visibility:**
- 75% of suppliers have limited visibility
- No primary data for benchmarking
- Limited forecasting capabilities

**System Integration:**
- Carbon data not in ERP (can't use sustainability in procurement)
- Spreadsheet-centric workflows (high friction)

---

## What They Want

**Short-term:**
- Export data with spend + embodied emissions columns
- Carbon intensity dashboard (SBTi-style, with timeline toggle)
- Forecast tool to measure 20% reduction path by 2030

**Medium-term:**
- Supplier engagement support (automated requests, templates, outreach)
- CCF & PCF progress dashboards
- Recommendations for carbon accounting tools for immature suppliers

---
