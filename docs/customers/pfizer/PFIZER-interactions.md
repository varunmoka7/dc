**Customer:** Pfizer Inc.
**Account Owner:** Alex Rudnicki (COO)
**Support:** Varun Moka (Scope 3 Support Executive)
**Document Purpose:** Chronological tracking of all interactions with Pfizer team

---

## October 30, 2025 - Product Feature Demo & Supplier Engagement Strategy

**Attendees:** Alex Rudnicki (COO), Varun Moka (Scope 3 Support Executive) | Efthymios (Sustainable Sourcing, Pfizer)

**Meeting Type:** Product demo, feature planning, strategy discussion

**Time:** 3pm Berlin time | **Duration:** ~45 minutes

**Note:** Elisa mentioned but not present (working with Maria on something)

### Context

**Varun's First Pfizer Call:**
- Day 3 at DitchCarbon
- Specifically requested to join this call (high interest in Pfizer)
- Had been reading Pfizer notes beforehand
- Building foundation for ongoing Pfizer relationship

**Efthymios Background (New Detail):**
- Key Pfizer contact: "Knows DitchCarbon best out of anyone at Pfizer" (Alex)
- Previously worked in compliance and procurement (finance background)
- Recently transitioned to sustainable sourcing role
- Quote: "I'm kind of bored with procurement, so that's why I also shift my gears"
- Working with Fred (VP of Procurement) on engagement KPIs

### Key Discussion Topics

#### 1. Supplier Claim Profile Feature (Launched Oct 30, 2025)

**Efthymios' Framing:**
- Had discussed this feature "long ago" but timing wasn't right previously
- **Now:** "I think now it's the right time to start sending to supplier"
- Wants to showcase DitchCarbon capabilities to suppliers serious about Scope 3
- Goal: Let suppliers see trajectory, understand expectations, provide responses

**Feature Overview (Demo by Alex):**

**Step 1: Dashboard Data Export**
- Click "dashboard data export" button
- New column: "Public Page" (URL for each supplier)

**Step 2: Supplier Claims Profile**
- Pfizer shares link with supplier (e.g., Publicis)
- Supplier clicks "Claim" button
- System verifies email domain matches company
- Creates account or logs into existing
- Claims profile

**Step 3: Supplier's View ("My Organization" Tab)**
- NEW TAB shows only their company (not others)
- Sees exact same view Pfizer sees:
  - **Forecast trajectory**
  - **Recommendations** (DitchCarbon's reduction suggestions)
  - **Scorecard** (how Pfizer evaluates them)
  - **All tabs** customer sees

**Step 4: Data Upload**
- Additional tab: "Upload Data"
- Supplier submits data directly
- Options: **Private** (just for Pfizer) or **Public** (available to any company)
- No more manual file transfers

**Value Proposition:**
- Pfizer: Eliminates manual file passing, suppliers self-serve
- Suppliers: Free value (scorecard, recommendations), understand expectations
- Serious suppliers: Can pay DitchCarbon for full Scope 3 platform (Pfizer discount available)

#### 2. Interactive Forecast Dashboard (Efthymios' Big Product Idea)

**Current Forecast Display:**
- **Red dotted line:** Supplier's committed target (SBTi, CDP)
- **Gold line:** 2-year historical trend
- **Purple line:** 5-year historical trend
- Insight: Recently improved suppliers show gold closer to target than purple

**Efthymios' Vision: Make It Interactive**

**Concept:**
1. Supplier sees trajectory based on public data
2. Below forecast: **3-4 short questions** (NOT long surveys - avoiding "survey fatigue")
3. Questions connect to **preset percentage changes** in forecast lines
4. As supplier selects responses, **forecast adjusts in real-time**
5. Supplier sees "new trajectory" based on planned decisions
6. Can export/screenshot to share with internal leadership

**Example Questions Efthymios Proposed:**
- "Based on current data, this is your trajectory. Is this realistic?"
- "Are you planning major capex/investments?" → If YES, forecast goes UP (~10%)
- "Are you planning to withdraw from commitments?" → If YES, shift to pessimistic scenario
- "Are you planning reduction investments?" → If YES, forecast goes DOWN

**Additional Features Requested:**
- **Comment box** below each question (supplier adds context)
- **Attachment option** (supplier uploads supporting docs)
- Result message: "Based on your responses, this would be your new trajectory"

**Supplier Value Proposition (Efthymios' Reasoning):**
- Many suppliers may not have visualized their own trajectory before
- Tool helps suppliers think through implications of decisions
- Can use internally: "Here's our path based on our decisions" (show CEO/leadership)
- **Brand value:** "Thanks to DitchCarbon" (suppliers appreciate tool)

**Pfizer Value Proposition:**
- Get **forward-looking information** (not just historical)
- Understand supplier investment plans and intentions
- More predictive segmentation (beyond backward-looking)
- Reduce need for manual surveys/outreach

**Alex's Response:**
- "Totally doable"
- Timeline: **By end of year** (pretty realistic)
- Questions alone = sooner
- Full interactivity with graph adjustment = more complex but achievable

**Technical Discussion:**

**Challenge: How to Let Suppliers Change Forecast**
- Current forecast = calculated from historical trends + targets
- Supplier input needed: "What is your carbon rate of change?"
- **Scope 1/2:** Suppliers likely CAN estimate (they control operations)
- **Scope 3:** Much harder to quantify
- Efthymios acknowledged: Even he (Scope 3 expert) knows big picture (-25% by 2030) but can't predict intensity

**Easiest Implementation (Alex's suggestion):**
1. **Preset questions** with supplier responses (visible to Pfizer)
2. Supplier can **comment** on forecast: "Do you think this is realistic?"
3. Display response on profile: "Supplier thinks forecast may be optimistic because heavier capex planned"
4. **Scope 1/2 trajectory editing** (suppliers more likely to have this data)
5. Sectoral/regional benchmarks as fallback lines

**Future Feature: Sectoral Benchmark Comparison**

**Current Forecast Sources:**
- Supplier's committed target
- Supplier's historical trend (2-year, 5-year)

**Potential Addition: Industry/Regional Expected Trajectory**
- Not supplier-specific, but **sector decarbonization expectations**
- Example: "Pharmaceutical manufacturers in India expected to decarbonize at X% rate"
- Based on:
  - % emissions from electricity × Indian grid decarbonization rate
  - Key material regulations
  - Regional commitments (India 2070, China 2060, Germany 2050)
  - Industry-specific goals (aviation, maritime = "roughly 2050")

**DitchCarbon Already Has This Data:**
- Used in "Forecasting" module for entire Pfizer project
- Could plot as additional line on supplier-level forecasts

#### 3. Peer Comparison & Confidentiality

**Varun's Suggestion:**
- Show supplier's data alongside peer data (same sector/region)
- Help suppliers benchmark themselves

**Efthymios' Response:**
- **Quote:** "This is a very tricky question in pharmaceuticals"
- Supplier name confidentiality = major concern
- Prefers **sectoral/regional commitments** over competitor names
- Avoid confidentiality risks

**Solution Agreed:**
- Use industry/regional expected trajectories instead of showing other supplier names
- Avoids confidentiality issues
- Still provides supplier context for self-assessment

#### 4. Monetization Strategy Discussion

**Efthymios' Suggestion:**
- Don't give suppliers **too much** for free
- **Quote:** "Give them something good, but don't give them too much"
- Hide comparison/benchmark tab unless supplier pays
- Sectoral benchmark comparison = potential paid feature
- **Quote:** "So I think this is too much... This is the first step, right? So we are paying 8,000 to see this kind of stuff"

**Agreed Tier Structure:**
- **Free tier:** Scorecard, trajectory, recommendations
- **Paid tier:** Scope 3 detail, benchmarking

**Alex's Response:**
- "I think that's a good suggestion"
- Main threshold: If suppliers want to manage **their own Scope 3 in detail** → must pay
- **Pfizer discount:** Suppliers can buy DitchCarbon platform with Pfizer-specific discount
- Rationale: Support Pfizer's ecosystem, make suppliers serious about Scope 3

### Strategic Context: Pfizer's Supplier Engagement Philosophy

**Problem Efthymios Wants to Avoid:**
- **Quote:** "This is what I'm trying to avoid... one hour calls... people that don't necessarily have an environmental and sustainability background... discussing because mainly they just need to discuss it and because someone else asked them to do so."
- Survey fatigue: Long meetings with procurement/account managers discussing sustainability without expertise
- Bureaucratic checkbox exercises without meaningful outcomes
- People participating because told to, not genuine engagement

**Desired Approach:**
- Simple, actionable, non-bureaucratic
- Enable conversations without requiring deep sustainability expertise
- Provide value to suppliers (not just data extraction)
- Time-efficient (3-4 questions, not 1-hour discussions)

**Alex's Alignment:**
- "How can we disarm any excuses?" → Remove all barriers
- Provide free tools (no excuse: "I didn't know how to do it")
- Make expectations crystal clear ("Pfizer is telling you it's important")
- Adequate timeline (5 years is enough - other companies reducing faster than Pfizer needs)

### Implementation Planning

**Next Steps for Interactive Dashboard:**

**Efthymios:**
- Work with Elisa on questionnaire design (3-4 questions per scope)
- Design questions: "What we want to ask suppliers to have clear view on future plans"
- Test claim profile feature using Pfizer's own profile (Alex to send link)
- Provide feedback on claim profile experience
- Decide supplier rollout strategy:
  - **Option A:** Mass email to 3,000 suppliers (mail merge template)
  - **Option B:** Category manager-led (during one-on-one conversations)

**Alex:**
- Review Efthymios' proposed questions once received
- Add DitchCarbon perspective from other customer learnings
- Combine into cohesive questionnaire
- Implement by **end of year** (realistic target)

**Testing Workflow:**
- Alex to send claim link for Pfizer's own profile
- Efthymios will claim it and test supplier experience
- Provide feedback before broader rollout

**Supplier Rollout Options:**

**Option A: Mass Email (Mail Merge)**
- Template: "Hi [Supplier Name]. Here's URL to claim your profile: [URL]. We'd love for you to check out DitchCarbon's recommendations."
- DitchCarbon provides: Supplier name field + URL field in export
- Scales to 3,000 suppliers easily

**Option B: Category Manager-Led**
- Category managers know claim profile available
- During supplier conversations: "Let's claim your profile now. Let's see what's in here."
- More hands-on, relationship-driven

**Efthymios' Preference:** TBD (will discuss with Elisa and Fred)

### Action Items

**Alex Rudnicki:**
- [ ] Send supplier claim profile demo video (if not already sent)
- [ ] Send Efthymios the claim link for Pfizer's own profile (for testing)
- [ ] Review Efthymios' proposed questions once received
- [ ] Implement interactive forecast dashboard questionnaire by end of year
- [ ] Explore adding sectoral/regional benchmark lines to forecasts
- [ ] Consider paid tier strategy for Scope 3 details and benchmarking

**Efthymios (Pfizer):**
- [ ] Work with Elisa on questionnaire design (3-4 questions per scope)
- [ ] Test claim profile feature using Pfizer's own profile
- [ ] Provide feedback on claim profile experience
- [ ] Decide supplier rollout strategy (mass email vs. category manager-led)
- [ ] Determine questions that capture supplier future plans/investments
- [ ] Meeting with Fred (VP Procurement) about engagement KPIs (next few weeks)

**Varun Moka:**
- [ ] Continue attending Pfizer calls and building relationship
- [ ] Support interactive dashboard implementation as needed
- [ ] Track Pfizer's feedback on claim profile feature rollout

### Key Learnings

**Product-Market Fit:**
1. **Timing is critical:** Feature wasn't ready before, now "the right time" (validated by Efthymios)
2. **Interactivity = engagement:** Suppliers more likely to engage if they see their own future, not just past
3. **Simplicity wins:** 3-4 questions max (not long surveys) - avoiding "survey fatigue"
4. **Value exchange matters:** Suppliers get trajectory visualization they may not have built internally

**Customer Success Patterns:**
5. **Avoid bureaucratic theater:** Procurement people discussing sustainability without expertise = waste
6. **Excuse elimination:** Make it so easy suppliers have no valid excuses
7. **Forward-looking data >> historical:** Pfizer wants supplier plans, not just past performance
8. **Monetization respect:** Give enough free value to engage, charge for deep Scope 3 work

**Technical & UX:**
9. **Scope 1/2 predictability >> Scope 3:** Suppliers can estimate operational emissions easier than value chain
10. **Sectoral benchmarks solve confidentiality:** Don't show competitor data, show industry trends
11. **Real-time interactivity = powerful UX:** Adjusting forecast lines as user answers questions
12. **Self-service reduces burden:** No more file passing, manual uploads, email chains

**Relationship Dynamics:**
13. **Collaborative product design:** Efthymios proposing features, Alex validating, iterating together
14. **Customer as co-creator:** Pfizer's needs directly shaping roadmap (interactive dashboard by EOY)
15. **Strategic alignment:** Both parties want to avoid wasting supplier time, provide real value
16. **Transparency on monetization:** Efthymios openly suggesting "don't give too much for free"

**Strategic Context:**
17. **Fred (VP Procurement) = key stakeholder:** Engagement KPIs for his team, meeting in next few weeks
18. **KPI shift: engagement vs. reduction (first 2 years):** More realistic, measurable for procurement
19. **5-year timeline adequate:** Other companies reducing faster than Pfizer needs for goals
20. **Pfizer setup ideal:** Central team + NetZero champions in sourcing zones = good structure

## October 29, 2025 - Supplier Engagement Strategy Discussion

**Attendees:** Alex (DitchCarbon), Pfizer team

### Key Themes: Supplier Target Tracking & Enablement

**Pfizer's Core Need:**
> "We really want to focus on suppliers sticking to their targets"

> "May be challenging to translate it into a very specific KPI"

### Supplier Identification & Engagement
**Process:**
1. Identify most important suppliers by category
2. Track their goals and current progress
3. Flag suppliers not on track
4. Category managers engage with flagged suppliers

### Technical Requirements
**Platform Capabilities Needed:**
- Track supplier declarations: "Are they on track for their goals even if forecast doesn't show it?"
- User-generated content: Suppliers can explain why they may look off-track but are actually on-track
- Overlay supplier explanations on top of data in profile

### DC Enablement Approach
**Workflow:**
1. **Generate List:** Suppliers not on track (platform identification)
2. **Category Manager Action:** Meet with suppliers during annual sustainability discussions
3. **Supplier Engagement:** Provide claim link for profile updates
4. **Conversation Topics:** Forecast review and recommendations discussion

### Pfizer's Internal Target
**Primary KPI:**
- % of emissions from suppliers that are "on track"

**Fred's Perspective:**
- Engagement metric: % of top suppliers where sustainability conversation occurred during the year
- Question for suppliers: "Are you actually on track?" (when forecast shows otherwise)

**Dana's Response:**
> "We'd be comfortable answering that question"

### Action Items
- [ ] Implement supplier "on track" declaration feature
- [ ] Enable UGC on supplier profiles for forecast explanations
- [ ] Track category manager engagement with suppliers
- [ ] Provide claim link workflow

## October 28, 2025 - Sync with Sandra: Fred's Report Structure

**Attendees:** Alex (DitchCarbon), Sandra (Pfizer)

### Report Outline for Fred (Procurement Leadership)

**Slide 1: Snapshot**
- Current state overview

**Slide 2: Focus on Key Sourcing Zones**
- **Top-Down:** "Here's how we can get there"
- **Identify:** Categories well above implied intensity target AND material
- **Forecast Analysis:** Categories unlikely to reduce by at least 25% without intervention

**Slide 3: Supplier-Level Focus**
- **Category Example:** Show one relevant category in detail
- **Top 5 Suppliers:** Dragging down key category performance
- **Screenshot:** Platform recommendations for these suppliers

**Slide 4: Enablement Actions**
1. **Claim Profile:** Suppliers submit additional data, see improvement opportunities (free)
2. **Training:** For category managers and suppliers on using platform information

**Slide 5: Success Metrics**
- **Platform Capability:** Already shows metrics on category basis
- **Open Question:** Which leading indicators can Pfizer track for quarterly updates (vs. annual backward-looking)?

### Key Context & Assumptions
- **Tracking Frequency:** Annual updates on absolute numbers
- **Absolute Target:** 25% reduction
- **Intensity Translation:** Can translate to intensity for internal procurement use
- **Action Framework:** "Do these three actions" + "Report updates quarterly"

### Platform Enhancement Request
**Question:** Can suppliers mark recommendations as "in progress" in the platform?
- Track if suppliers have actioned recommendations
- Enable progress visibility between annual cycles

### Pfizer's Philosophy
> "We don't want to tell suppliers what to do, we want to give them support to do it"

> "Avoid getting into the minutia" - 3-4 slides to set the tone, then discuss with Fred

### Varun's Feedback to Sandra and Dana

**On Intensity Targets:**
- **Procurement Perspective:** Intensity targets are reasonable for procurement teams
- **Translation Approach:** Can easily translate sustainability's absolute target into implied intensity target
- **Risk Management:** Spend assumptions can change (e.g., COVID scenario)
  - Absolute targets become impossible if spend drops
  - Intensity targets remain achievable
- **Strategic Importance:** Fred is their most important internal stakeholder
  - Target must be both ambitious AND achievable
  - Need Fred's buy-in for success

### Action Items
- [ ] Create 3-4 slide deck for Fred
- [ ] Focus on key sourcing zones (top-down approach)
- [ ] Identify material categories above implied intensity target
- [ ] Show supplier-level examples with recommendations
- [ ] Define quarterly tracking approach

**2. Report for Fred**
- [ ] **Timing:** End of October (after Dana's vacation)
- [ ] **Content:** Intensity KPI and key actions by sourcing category to hit 2030 goal
- [ ] **Required:** Maria wants Dana present for the meeting

### Team Observations

**Elissa:**
- Appears junior on the team
- Currently figuring out ins and outs of GHG measurement
- Learning curve on emissions frameworks

### Case Study Collaboration

**Limitations:**
- Cannot create video case study (legal restrictions)
- Can mention collaboration in DitchCarbon's annual impact report

**PSCI Meeting (Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative):**
- **Date:** Next week (week of October 21)
- **Pfizer Sharing:** Thursday presentation
- **Content:** Mention DC collaboration
- **Audience:** 100s of suppliers, 80+ peer companies

### Tech Plan & Platform Strategy

**NZC Exit:**
- Exiting Net Zero Coalition after 2025
- Transitioning to SBTi engagement tracking

**Reporting Tool RFP:**
- Pushed to 2026
- Will begin using new tool in 2027

**DC Methodology:**
> "We'd like to use DC methodology for 2025 reporting"

**Baseline Change:**
> "Changing baseline to 2025 so we can stick with it"

### Pfizer's Technical Asks

**1. Comprehensive Measurement**
- **Requirement:** Whole company measured (not just top 3,000 suppliers)
- **Challenge:** How to handle long tail suppliers
- **Status:** Fine with approach, need tail handling strategy

**2. Third-Party Verification**
- **Auditor:** ERM is their third-party verifier
- **Requirement:** ERM will sample DC data
- **Need:** Ensure data audit-ready

**3. SBTi Engagement Target**
- **Current State:** Suppliers have Scope 1+2 data, not Scope 3
- **Need:** Platform must capture Scope 1+2 supplier data
- **Challenge:** System currently optimized for Scope 3 tracking

**4. Data Freezing for Verification**
- **Requirement:** Emissions as of specific date, verified and frozen
- **Use Case:** 2025 baseline for reporting consistency
- **Need:** Version control on emissions data

### Other Platform Requirements

**PCF Data Integration:**
- Schedule meeting: Sandra + Efthymios
- Discuss: How to use PCF data in their calculations
- Timeline: TBD

**Internal Target Setting (Maria's Boss Request):**
- **Goal:** Intensity target for Fred by sourcing group
- **Purpose:** Get realistic about 2026 goals
- **Rationale:** Intensity speaks procurement's language ($/emissions)

### Detailed Analysis Requirements

**By Sourcing Group:**
- Custom filter capability (product vs. spreadsheet exercise)
- Intensity target as KPI
- Both forecast and team recommendations filtered

**By Category Group:**
- Top 50 suppliers in 2030 (pessimistic forecast)
- Annual reduction needed per supplier
- Material suppliers dragging down category performance

**Spend Forecast Assumptions:**
- **Near-term (Next few years):** Assume no growth in spend
- **Out-years (to 2030):** Some growth expected
- **Data Quality Note:** Need to check their own spend and material group/category classifications
  - Some Scope 1 and Scope 2 in their Scope 3 data due to SAP classifications
  - Don't want this issue to hold up initial Fred discussion

**Category Example - PGS:**
- "PGS needs to reduce X by Y"
- External CMO category similar analysis

### Other Scope 3 Categories

**Non-Supplier Categories:**
- Improving with existing service provider
- Not planning to use DC for these categories
- Focus DC on supplier-related Scope 3 only

### Action Items from Meeting
- [ ] Send PCF functionality video
- [ ] Schedule Sandra + Efthymios PCF implementation call
- [ ] Develop data freezing/versioning approach for ERM audit
- [ ] Add Scope 1+2 data capture for SBTi engagement tracking
- [ ] Build custom filter by sourcing organization
- [ ] Create Fred's report: Intensity targets by sourcing group
- [ ] Define long tail supplier handling strategy
