### Platform Needs
1. **Supplier Tracking**
   - Forecast vs. target analysis
   - "On track" declarations (UGC on supplier profiles)
   - Recommendation progress tracking
   - Custom filters by sourcing organization

2. **Reporting & Exports**
   - Dashboard exports with methodology transparency
   - Quarterly progress tracking
   - Intensity metrics in Calculate module
   - Scope 1+2 data capture (not just Scope 3)

3. **Supplier Enablement**
   - Claim profile functionality (free for suppliers)
   - Supplier training on platform usage
   - Recommendations visibility
   - Connection to Scope 2 reduction partners (e.g., APAC renewables)

## Strategic Priorities

### Fred's Report (Internal Procurement Target)
- **Goal:** Set realistic 2026 internal targets by sourcing group
- **Deliverables:**
  - Intensity KPI by sourcing group and category
  - Top-down: How to achieve 27.5% reduction
  - Bottom-up: Which categories are least competitive vs. peers
  - Top 50 suppliers in 2030 (pessimistic scenario)
  - Annual reduction needed per category

### Supplier Engagement Strategy
- **Focus:** Support over directive ("don't tell suppliers what to do")
- **Actions:**
  1. Identify suppliers not on track
  2. Category managers have annual conversations
  3. Provide claim link for supplier data updates
  4. Track recommendation implementation

### Leading Indicators
- **Challenge:** Quarterly tracking vs. annual data updates
- **Solution Needed:** Track supplier actions (in progress, completed) on recommendations

## Account Health

### Strengths
- Long-term engagement (since 2024)
- Multiple stakeholder relationships
- Complex, high-value use case
- Strategic alignment with procurement

### Risks & Challenges

- **Competitor Pressure:** CDP offering more granular data
- **Data Complexity:** 2019 baseline, 2024 forecast, industry mapping
- **Scope Creep:** Multiple projects by buying category
- **Verification Pressure:** Third-party auditor requirements

### Critical Success Factors
1. Deliver Fred's report successfully (procurement buy-in)
2. Demonstrate value vs. CDP alternative
3. Enable successful supplier engagement
4. Provide quarterly tracking capabilities
5. Maintain data quality and verification standards
