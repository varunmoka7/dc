### Detailed Discussion Notes

#### 1. Corporate Transformation Context

**Howden's Organizational Changes:**
- Transitioning from federated (isolated regional entities) to centralized corporate services division
- New corporate functions division aiming to globalize processes and data
- Currently: each global entity (Dual North America, Dual LatAm, etc.) operates largely in isolation
- Goal: standardize approach across procurement, travel, property, facilities, etc.

**Impact on DitchCarbon:**
- BW (Barnett Waddingham subsidiary) is currently separate entity; will align financially next year
- Source-to-pay system project underway with external consultants gathering spend data
- Better data quality and standardization = improved DitchCarbon inputs
- Opportunity for expanded platform usage as integration deepens

**Tim's Quote:** "We've been quite federated in the way that we work... now we've got a corporate services function that's looking to standardize the approach."

---

#### 2. Carbon Reporting & Limited Assurance Exercise

**First-Time Limited Assurance:**
- Howden has never done limited assurance before
- Target: Public carbon data disclosure by mid-early March 2026
- Process aligned with Howden's accounting/finance timelines
- Coordinated through new disclosure committee running out of finance

**Assurance Timeline:**
1. **Early January 2026:** Assurance exercise kicks off
2. **Mid-early March 2026:** Deadline for public release
3. **November 24, 2025:** Data snapshot date (end of business)

**Hard Deadlines Introduced:**
- Tim noted this is different from previous fluid processes
- New structure includes hard deadlines for each data collection stage
- "We've been a bit fluid before... we've got a far more robust process now"

**DitchCarbon's Role:**
- Provide auditor access to platform
- Export audit files showing data sources, calculation details, supplier information
- Share UL-assured methodology documentation
- Offer call with auditors if needed for sign-off
- Create permanent snapshot on data close date (Nov 24)

---

#### 3. Supplier Spend Data & Sources

**Current Data:**
- Top 2,000 suppliers currently in DitchCarbon
- Primary source: Unit 4 system
- Current spend threshold: ~£16,000 (lowest spend value in current data)

**New Data Source (Expected):**
- External consultants have been gathering spend data across all Howden entities for several months
- Source-to-pay system implementation project
- Expected availability: approximately next week from Oct 28
- May reveal additional suppliers beyond Unit 4 system
- Tim to review and confirm final threshold once consultant data received

**Data Strategy Discussion:**
- Howden expects huge long-tail of suppliers (like most enterprises)
- Not interested in detailed tracking for every supplier
- Want to set meaningful threshold (likely around 2,000 suppliers individually tracked)
- DitchCarbon proposed: track detailed data above threshold, bucket long-tail by category
- Approach provides 100% spend coverage with detail where needed

**Alex's Recommendation:** "So that can be done in ditch carbon exported to Salesforce, net zero cloud, very simply. Right. And so then you actually have 100% coverage of your spend, but you see the detail where you want to see it."

---

#### 4. Custom Filtering & Data Organization

**Custom Filter Columns Available:**
- DitchCarbon supports up to 4 custom columns per project
- Filters apply in web app AND export files
- Useful for different user roles to see relevant data

**Howden's Planned Use:**
1. **Pillars/Entities Column:** Map spend to Howden's business divisions (Dual North America, Dual LatAm, BW, main Howden, others)
2. **Procurement Categories Column:** Align with global category manager structure (details TBD)
3. Additional columns: TBD (depending on organizational needs)

**Benefits:**
- Category managers see only suppliers in their category (not all 2,000)
- VP of each pillar can see their business pillar data
- Reduces data clutter, improves usability
- Alignment with procurement team's direction (moving toward global category managers)

**Tim's Response:** "That is the direction of travel with our procurement team... part of the plan is to integrate category managers across the key categories. So I will request what those are and we can see if we can start to use those across our upload."

#### 5. Salesforce Net Zero Cloud Integration

**Overall Process:**
1. DitchCarbon exports supplier emissions data
2. DitchCarbon pre-formats CSV for Salesforce compatibility
3. Howden's internal Salesforce admin team loads into Net Zero Cloud
4. Snapshot date: November 24

**Pre-formatting Details:**
- DitchCarbon handles formatting to align data models
- Effort: ~1-2 hours per upload cycle
- Eliminates manual work on Howden's side

**Howden's Salesforce Setup:**
- Internal CRM team (3-4 people) manages: Salesforce CRM, Net Zero Cloud, Marketing Cloud
- They handle all development and data uploads
- Howden doesn't have direct Salesforce support contract
- Team is familiar with data objects and integration patterns

**Emissions Factors:**
- Howden team has selected factors for Scopes 1 & 2
- **PGS (Purchase Goods & Services) factors:** Awaiting DitchCarbon alignment
- Alex to coordinate with Howden's Salesforce admin team directly
- Factors will be included in Nov 24 snapshot export

**Currency & Technical Details Issue:**
- Previous templates required Euros (unusual for UK company)
- Ellen raised concern: "We also had a country code which. Tim, I don't know if we've spoken to Kushwi if those things are going to be needed again."
- Tim and Ellen to discuss with Kushboo/Compass team about switching to GBP
- May need country codes for new process
- Action: Confirm requirements with Compass IT

**Alex's approach:** "I'm very confident Salesforce can support EBP and USD" (& GBP)

---

#### 6. Data Submission & Timeline

**Critical Dates:**
- **Nov 10:** Ellen submits data inputs to DitchCarbon (deadline)
- **Nov 24:** Compass IT uploads to Salesforce (hard deadline for Howden IT process)
- **2-week buffer:** From Ellen's submission (Nov 10) to IT upload (Nov 24)

**Timeline Rationale:**
- DitchCarbon needs ~2 weeks for validation and processing
- Accounts for supplier volume, data nuances, quality checks
- Flexibility: if fewer new suppliers, DitchCarbon can accelerate (days instead of weeks)

**Alex's Recommendation:** "I would say, I mean, you don't have a ton of suppliers, so we could get it done within a week. It depends on how many new suppliers there are. So I'd say two weeks to be safe would be good."

**Outstanding Data Requirements:**
- Ellen still needs to see the consultant-gathered spend data download
- Once reviewed, Ellen may have template mapping questions
- Howden to provide any unique IDs used internally for supplier mapping

---

#### 7. Contract Renewal & Pricing

**Current Terms:**
- Contract expires: Mid-late December 2025
- ACV: £16,000
- Current users: ~10 (including BW team)

**Renewal Pricing:**
- Planned increase: Inflation only (no major uptick)
- Rationale: Howden is "easy to work with," pays below-average compared to similar customers
- Not seeking big increase unless scope changes significantly

**Variables Affecting Pricing:**
- Third-party risk management team may want access (Tim meeting with them Oct 29)
- Currently expected: reports/insights only, NOT new system functionality
- Unlikely to drive major cost increases

**Services Included (No Change):**
- Auditing process support (already included)
- Salesforce Net Zero Cloud integration
- Standard platform access and maintenance

**Services NOT Included (Potential Cost Driver):**
- Custom integrations requiring dedicated DitchCarbon engineering

**Next Steps:**
- Tim to confirm user base after third-party risk team meeting (Oct 29)
- Alex to follow up in 1-2 weeks
- Alex confident renewal will be straightforward

**Alex's Quote:** "Candidly, you're paying a lot less than other customers, but we're not planning to ask for a big increase. I think Mark has in mind just inflation... you all have been easy to work with."

#### 8. Auditor Access & Assurance Process

**How It Works:**
- DitchCarbon provides auditors with direct platform access
- All data is exportable in audit-ready format
- Audit file includes:
  - Supplier-specific emissions data
  - Data points used in calculations
  - Sources of data (documentation)
  - Calculation methodology

**Auditor Spot Checks:**
- Typical process: auditors do spot checks on sample suppliers
- Review source documents
- Verify calculation sources

**DitchCarbon's Backing:**
- **UL Assurance:** DitchCarbon's entire methodology has been assured by UL (leading global carbon assurer)
- Methodology document provided to auditor
- Often addresses most auditor questions
- DitchCarbon willing to have call with auditor if needed

**Tim's Response:** "All right, that sounds good. Can you... [continuing discussion on process]"

**Key Advantage:** UL assurance significantly reduces auditor friction compared to unverified methodologies

---

#### 9. Key Recommendations from Alex

**1. Unique IDs:**
- Provide any internal IDs (procurement system IDs, Net Zero Cloud IDs) used internally
- Makes it easy to map DitchCarbon data back to internal systems
- Important for future data movement/integration

**Example:** "So we have some Net Zero Cloud users that like using the Net Zero cloud id because then that makes it simple. We have some that have a unique ID in their procurement system for suppliers and they want to map it back to that."

**2. Emissions Factor Selection:**
- Let DitchCarbon handle pre-formatting for Salesforce
- Howden's team can select factors, DitchCarbon handles technical integration
- Quick process (~1-2 hours)

**3. Custom Columns Planning:**
- Finalize pillar/entity structure early
- Identify procurement categories that matter for filtering
- Can add more later if needed

**4. Admin Team Connection:**
- Connect with Salesforce admin team early
- Show them exactly what DitchCarbon will be sending
- Prevent surprises/delays during integration
