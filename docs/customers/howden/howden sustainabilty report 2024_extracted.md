Message from our CEO
We worked closely with clients to 
address the challenges – and seize the 
opportunities – of a more sustainable 
future. Our research with Boston 
Consulting Group highlighted the 
additional $10 trillion of insurance 
coverage needed to unlock the climate 
transition. In June, we brought together 
public and private sector leaders to 
discuss how to bridge that gap at the 
first ever De-risking Summit. And we 
continued driving this agenda throughout 
the year not least at November’s COP29.
Our actions in 2024 included:
•	 launching innovative new insurance 
products to de-risk investment in 
the technologies needed for a net-
zero future – such as a first-of-its-
kind insurance facility to cover the 
environmental damage and loss arising 
from the leakage of CO2 from Carbon 
Capture and Storage projects
•	 growing our data and insight 
capabilities to help clients better 
understand their climate risks and 
increase their resilience – including 
working with Microsoft to establish the 
Howden Resilience Laboratory  
•	 collaborating with city leaders across 
three continents to build urban 
resilience – from reducing the risk of 
wildfires for homeowners in California 
and quantifying the hidden cost of 
flooding in Cape Town to increasing 
water resilience in Lagos – in the 
second year of the Global Risk and 
Resilience Fellowship
2024 saw us step up on the humanitarian 
front too. We brought together the 
insurance industry to launch Humanity 
Insured (HI)  – a global not-for-profit that 
is helping make insurance accessible and 
effective for people living on the climate 
crisis frontline.
In just three months, HI mobilised more 
than £42 milllion of insurance capacity to 
support a million people from West Africa 
to Papua New Guinea. And, at the time 
of writing, the charity is already having 
an impact with a number of significant 
claims paid out.
In its 10th year, our corporate foundation, 
the Howden Foundation, grew its portfolio 
of long-term partnerships in pursuit of 
its vision of a world where everyone is 
resilient to the impacts of climate change. 
All the while, the Foundation continued 
to drive employee giving with a bumper 
year of matched funding and donations 
through its employee-nominated annual 
charity awards.
In fact, 2024 saw colleagues volunteer 
nearly 15,000 hours and raise almost 
£900,000 for more than 1,000 charities 
across 32 countries. In the UK, our 
people selected Maggie’s cancer 
care as the new charity partner – raising 
more than £400,000 in the first year of 
the two-year partnership.
Once again, the teams in DUAL Australia 
and New Zealand led the global giving 
charge. And they celebrated their 
20th year in the best way possible – 
by raising even more and smashing 
through two major milestones with their 
long-term mental health charity partner, 
Black Dog Institute.
Meanwhile, we continued embedding 
sustainability at the core of our operations 
– setting a 2040 net zero target, evolving 
our carbon offset portfolio, and improving 
energy-efficiency and waste management 
measures across our offices and branches.
2024 was the year we celebrated our 
30th anniversary. We’ve grown as a 
company from three people and a dog 
to more than 22,000 in 56 countries. Yet 
we remain a business that continues to 
place employee ownership at the heart of 
what we do - with employees our largest 
single shareholder group. And what could 
be more sustainable than those who own 
the business doing the business! But 
2024 was also a year in which we vowed 
to keep upping our game. The challenges 
humanity faces aren’t going away any 
time soon. So, while 2024 was a year of 
action and impact, our challenge is to 
think ahead to the next 30 years and keep 
raising the bar.
David Howden
Chief Executive Officer
We worked closely with clients to address 
the challenges – and seize the opportunities 
– of a more sustainable future.”
In a year that was officially the hottest 
on record and in which extreme weather 
events topped the World Economic 
Forum charts of long-term global risk, 
we accelerated our efforts to help create 
a fairer, more resilient world.

•	 The Audit committee: is responsible 
for the integrity of the group’s 
financial reporting including the 
effectiveness of the internal control 
and risk management system and 
for monitoring the effectiveness 
and objectivity of internal and 
external auditors. The committee’s 
remit extends to the whole of the 
group’s business and includes 
oversight of principle subsidiary audit 
committees as part of the overall 
governance framework. 
•	 Remuneration committee: 
ensures executive remuneration 
is fair, competitive, and aligned 
with performance, shareholder 
interests, and legal requirements. 
Recommendations are made to the 
board, and the committee reviews its 
performance and terms of reference 
every three years to promote 
effectiveness.
•	 Nomination Committee: the Terms 
of Reference for a Nomination 
Committee is agreed in principle 
and the formation is underway. The 
committee’s role will be to lead the 
appointment process, support orderly 
succession plans to both the board 
and senior management positions, and 
oversee the development of a diverse 
pipeline for succession. A majority of 
the members will be independent non-
executive directors.
Strategic leadership 
and decision making
Our approach to governance is founded 
upon a culture of transparency and 
empowerment. Whilst the board provides 
strategic direction, it does not intrude 
or interfere in the day-to-day operations 
of the group and its trading companies. 
Instead, the Group Leadership Team 
(GLT) and the Business Management 
Team (BMT) drive cultural and operational 
decision-making and maintain oversight 
through strong governance structures.
The GLT fosters collaboration across 
businesses to promote transparency and 
alignment, while the BMT supports the 
operational and strategic direction of the 
group. This approach reinforces our flat 
hierarchy and empowers business leaders 
to deliver on their objectives whilst allowing 
alignment with our governance framework.
Board and committees
The board includes the Chairman, CEO, 
CFO, COO and a team of non-executive 
directors with a range of experience 
across industries and regulatory 
landscapes. Chaired by independent 
non-executive directors, various board 
committees support the board.
•	 The Risk committee: provides 
leadership, direction and oversight 
of the group’s overall risk appetite, 
tolerance and strategy, overseeing and 
advising the board on the current and 
potential future risk exposures of the 
group, reviewing and approving the 
group’s risk management framework, 
and monitoring its effectiveness and 
adherence to the various risk policies. 
Our Group ESG & Sustainability 
Committee and Diversity & Inclusion 
Committee are chaired by non-executive 
directors of the board and comprise of 
senior leadership and internal subject 
matter experts: 
•	 ESG & Sustainability Committee: 
plays a crucial role in supporting the 
board by providing strategic direction 
on sustainability and ESG matters 
concerning employees, suppliers, 
investors, and society. The purpose of 
the committee is to lead the Group’s 
environment and sustainability 
strategy, oversee environment 
and sustainability reporting, and 
offer guidance on related policies 
and procedures. Furthermore, the 
committee reviews environmental 
and sustainability data and metrics, 
liaises with the Group Risk and Audit 
Committees on relevant metrics, and 
reviews regulatory and compliance 
matters concerning environment 
and sustainability topics. This 
comprehensive oversight ensures the 
effective implementation of sustainable 
practices across the Group.
•	 Diversity & Inclusion Committee: 
is responsible for encouraging 
opportunities for all, and to nurture 
an inclusive working environment. 
It provides guidance and support to 
regional and divisional diversity and 
inclusion efforts. The committee is also 
responsible for tracking demographic 
data as required by law. 
Strong corporate governance is fundamental to Howden. 
It allows decisions to be made with a balanced assessment 
of relevant considerations, and that policies and procedures 
uphold transparency, accountability, and the provision of 
accurate information to stakeholders.

As the world faces the 
interdependent climate change 
and biodiversity crises, insurance 
must play its role as the ‘great 
enabler’ of the resilient transition 
to a net-zero economy.
This year the Climate Risk and Resilience 
(CRR) team continued building an expert, 
full spectrum function to support the 
business globally, integrating climate 
and resilience into client solutions 
as applicable.
Cementing our position as an industry 
leader, we focused on demonstrating the 
critical role of insurance in enabling and 
accelerating a just, resilient transition to 
net zero.
Key milestones in 2024 included the 
second year of the Global Risk and 
Resilience Fellowship, the creation of a 
pioneering carbon capture and storage 
(CCS) leakage facility, and a collaboration 
with Microsoft to launch the Howden 
Resilience Laboratory.
During London Climate Action Week in 
June 2024, we convened the inaugural 
De-Risking Summit at Mansion House 
in London, bringing together over 300 
Enabling the transition

Building on the success of the event, 
we collaborated with Boston Consulting 
Group (BCG) and the UN Climate 
Change High-Level Champions to 
share innovative insurance approaches 
to increase the bankability of climate 
projects. Our joint report, titled ‘The 
Great Enabler’, was released at the 
UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP29) 
and highlighted real-world examples, 
identified key challenges, and presented 
11 high-impact insurance solutions.
Led by Howden’s CRR team, and together 
with world-leading private and public 
sector partners, we believe that we are 
fast becoming a transformative force in 
the market, expanding and accelerating 
the role of insurance to make impact 
at speed.

We’re challenging the conventional 
use of insurance in project financing 
to show how it can lower the cost 
of capital. 
The global CCS market is projected to 
reach a value of $7.49 billion by 2030 at a 
compound annual growth rate of 19.9% 
between 2023 and 20301, accelerating 
the need for effective insurance solutions 
to protect the financial viability and 
stability of CCS projects. 
We’re presenting risk management 
solutions that, when integrated into a 
comprehensive programme, we believe 
can shift financiers’ perceptions of the 
risk profile associated with CCS projects.
Use of insurance to de-risk finance 
is a key goal of our CRR team so that 
this can unlock investment in resilient 
and low carbon infrastructure. This 
involves collaboration with Howden 
broking teams to deliver insurance 
solutions to market. To date, these 
include insurance solutions for carbon 
capture and storage facilities (CCS) 
and groundbreaking products for the 
Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM).
In 2024, we announced a first-of-its-kind 
insurance facility, designed to address 
leakage risks from CCS facilities that 
are not accounted for under traditional 
insurance products.

The Bigger Picture  
a Howden report
According to the research, $19 trillion 
in investment capital has already been 
committed by energy companies, 
governments, and private equity to 
finance the climate transition through to 
2030*, a figure that is equivalent to the 
combined annual GDP of the twenty-
seven nations of the European Union.
However, too few projects meet the risk 
thresholds required by investors. To 
unlock this enormous sum, the insurance 
industry will need to provide more 
than $10 trillion in additional coverage, 
including for innovative insurance 
solutions that will help make climate 
projects investable. It is only by de-risking 
investments in climate technologies and 
nature-based solutions that businesses, 
governments, and investors will be able 
to drive the transition forward.
	Click here to read  
the full report
Our joint report with Boston Consulting 
Group was a wake-up call to markets 
and clients, which galvanised broader 
climate finance leaders from banking 
and investment to position insurance 
in strategic planning to address climate 
transition challenges.

Managing risk is one of the biggest barriers to a just

across sectors and industries globally to shape 
a net zero, fair future for all.”

Together with key partners, we’re 
leveraging a unique public-private 
approach to building urban resilience.
Supporting urban resilience planning
The Global Risk and Resilience Fellowship
The value of enhanced urban resilience 
is considerable, but realising its full 
potential requires investment. While 
insurance is a vital component, it cannot 
serve as the sole solution. Cities urgently 
need financing to leverage insurance 
for scaling adaptation efforts. Financial 
institutions and the insurance sector 
must collaborate with cities to unlock 
the necessary financing at the scale 
required to achieve a sustainable and 
equitable future.
In 2024, Howden, with the Resilient 
Cities Network and the Sustainable 
Markets Initiative, built on the successful 
implementation of the inaugural 2023 
‘Fellowship’, to deliver the second year of 
the Global Risk and Resilience Fellowship 
(‘the Fellowship’). 
The Fellowship’s mission is to deliver 
increased city resilience through 
measurable action. 
The 2024 Fellowship worked with 
five cities across three continents: 
Manchester, UK; Lagos, Nigeria; Norfolk, 
USA; Oakland, USA; and Cape Town, 
South Africa. 
Across these five diverse cities, there 
were three central themes that united the 
2024 fellowship projects: 
1.	The need for cities to assess and 
articulate the cost of failing to adapt to 
flooding and other climate perils. 
2.	A consideration of how insurance can 
de-risk investment to reduce the cost 
of capital required to build adaptive 
infrastructure. 
3.	The evaluation of how innovative 
parametric insurance can be coupled 
with other tools to manage the 
increasingly severe climate shocks 
already faced by cities.
	A detailed overview of the outcomes 
of the 2024 Fellowship projects are 
discussed in this report
By harnessing the collective 
power and knowledge of 
cities and the private sector, 
the Fellowship has been able 
to explore innovative ways 
of addressing risk and drive 
meaningful investment in the 
future of our cities.”

This shift has been fuelled by the 
indemnity market cycle hardening in 
recent years, as well as to continued 
advancements in technology, and the 
increasingly complex profile of emerging 
risks related to climate change. Keeping 
up with this change and demand, Howden 
is investing and expanding in parametric 
risk transfer solutions, tailored to address 
the growing necessity to de-risk across 
industries, financial markets, and the 
public sector.
Parametric solutions for 
underserved populations
Building preparedness on the climate 
frontline remains a strategic priority, 
and in 2024, Howden announced the 
acquisition of MiCRO, a microinsurance 
specialist that designs and implements 
parametric insurance coverage for 
underserved populations in Latin 
America, spanning Guatemala, 
El Salvador, Colombia, and Mexico. 
Our aligned mission is to invest in 
innovative and value-adding insurance 
solutions that sustainably enhance 
resilience in emerging markets, especially 
amid increasing climate catastrophes.
Index-based insurance products 
designed by MiCRO triggered $5.9 million 
in payouts benefiting almost 60,000 
insureds in 2024 to recover faster from 
severe drought and excess rain events 
in the region. For instance, in Guatemala, 
during a devastating 2024 rainy season, 
there were at least 28 deaths, tens of 
thousands of people evacuated, and 
more than 8,600 buildings damaged as 
well as over 400 roads and at least five 
bridges destroyed. MiCRO’s insurance 
solutions led to over $2.3 million in 
payouts for almost 29,000 people 
affected. The MiCRO proprietary platform 
enabled fast electronic payouts allowing 
communities to recover more quickly and

Innovative insurance for building resilience 
Case study: 
An innovative 
approach to disaster 
relief for the Miami 
Foundation 
Building on the results of the Global Risk 
and Resilience Fellowship in Miami-
Dade County, Howden helped The 
Miami Foundation place a parametric 
policy that triggers in the event of a Cat 
3 or higher hurricane making landfall, 
supporting disaster preparedness and 
equitable long-term recovery. 
Miami faces an increase in the 
frequency and intensity of tropical 
storms, hurricanes and storm surges 
bringing South Florida’s ability to 
pioneer climate resiliency into sharp 
focus. The physical risks of extreme 
weather events caused by climate 
change are one of the most pressing 
resilience challenges for city officials 
and local livelihoods. 
Howden worked closely with the 
Miami Foundation to develop different 
parametric concepts that would reduce 
vulnerability to climate-related risks by 
removing existing coverage gaps.
The Foundation purchased a policy 
against a hurricane making landfall, with 
payouts triggered by wind speed and 
the proximity of an arriving storm. 
This allowed the philanthropic 
community to provide crucial financial 
support to Greater Miami’s most 
vulnerable communities the moment 
they need it most: immediately after 
disaster strikes. The policy’s rapid 
fund release will allow the Foundation 
to quickly move money to the non 
profits acting as first responders in 
their communities, strengthening 
their capacity to activate swiftly and 
effectively during a crisis.
Moreover, the pre-arranged payout 
structures of such parametric policies 
offer a degree of predictability during 
otherwise uncertain times, bolstering 
pre-crisis preparation. 
The 2024 disaster season marked the 
first time that the Foundation invested 
in a parametric insurance policy, making 
it one of the nation’s first philanthropic 
institutions to explore this approach to 
disaster relief.

Parametric insurance is fast gaining 
ground across our markets. Unlike 
traditional indemnity insurance, 
which pays out based on the extent 
of the loss, parametric insurance 
provides payouts based on the 
severity or frequency of an event.

UN Climate Change  
High-Level Champions
The UN Climate Change High-Level 
Champions accelerate climate action 
by connecting the work of governments 
with the many voluntary and collaborative 
solutions provided by cities, regions, 
businesses, investors and more. 
This includes delivering the five-year 
plan of the Marrakech Partnership, in 
collaboration with the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) secretariat and 
other partners. 
In response to our Bigger Picture report’s 
call to action, Howden announced 
a collaboration with the UN Climate 
Change High-Level Champions to 
enable climate insurance breakthroughs. 
This collaboration aims to foster 
insurer-client collaboration to enhance 
risk understanding, work with key 
industries to de-risk projects, unlock 
new insurance capacity, and support 
low-carbon investments.
In 2024, Howden and the UN Climate 
Change High-Level Champions led 
the way in establishing the insurance 
industry formally in global climate finance 
discussions for the first time.
On Finance Day at COP29, we ran the 
Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate 
Action Implementation Focus Lab. It 
centred on the role the insurance industry 
must play in unlocking capital and the 
delivery plan to mobilise insurance, 
industry and finance to de-risk and 
accelerate the implementation 
of the High-Level Champions 2023 
Climate Solutions.
The (re)insurance sector 
Throughout the year, we worked to 
bring together the (re)insurance market, 
leveraging our role as a broker to deliver 
optimal solutions for our clients and 
foster a sustainable market for parties. 
We believe our relationship with the 
market is integral to our mission. It 
extends beyond the insurance solutions 
we jointly bring to market, encompassing 
our efforts to shape a market that is 
sustainable and future proof. As outlined 
in our whitepaper ‘The Great Enabler’, we 
regularly engage in collaboration centred 
around a shared vision for the insurance 
industry’s role in supporting society’s 
efforts to address the dual challenges 
of climate change and biodiversity loss. 
We take great pride in being a trusted 
advisor, as well as advocate and leader 
within the market, supporting industry 
stakeholders in their strategic planning 
for the energy transition and addressing 
the future insurability challenges posed 
by climate change. 
The Cambridge Institute for 
Sustainability Leadership
As a member of the Cambridge Institute 
for Sustainability Leadership’s (CISL) 
ClimateWise, in 2024 we explored 
innovative nature-related financial 
opportunities, focusing on the role of 
mangroves, coral reefs, and seagrasses in 
supporting and safeguarding near-shore 
fisheries in Bolinao, Philippines. The report 
also examined how insurance can be 
used to enhance the financial resilience 
of small-scale fishing communities. 
This collaboration expands on a 2023 
report by the CISL, where we contributed 
to a compelling action plan. Illustrating a 
first step for implementation of loss and 
damage risk sharing systems, the authors 
evaluated how an initial allocation of 
$10 million premium support per country 
could generate immediate protection, at 
scale, through the risk capital markets. 
Each country would receive on average 
$200 to $300 million in pre-arranged 
annual protection to support their highest 
priority needs for more frequent climate 
shocks: e.g. humanitarian response, 
recovery of schools, hospitals and 
critical infrastructure; sovereign debt 
repayments; agricultural support; and 
restoration of marine and terrestrial 
ecosystems.

In collaboration with Pollination, a 
specialist climate and nature solutions 
firm, our Through the Wilderness 
report highlighted the four important 
ways that insurance can enable 
investment in nature. Illustrated by 
real-world use cases, we presented 
our recommendations at the Sixteenth 
meeting of the Conference of the Parties 
to the Convention on Biological Diversity 
(COP16), held in Cali, Colombia in 
November 2024. 
Four key roles for the insurance sector 
to unlock finance for nature: 
1.	Risk transfer to mobilise capital 
2.	Protecting natural assets 
3.	Enabling trading in environmental 
markets 
4.	Governance 
Howden’s CRR team is actively 
supporting solutions within each of these 
priority areas, including by expanding 
insurance coverage for the carbon 
markets, and using insurance to promote 
effective governance in these markets.

Carbon credits warranty 
and indemnity insurance 
Insurance instils fundamental buy-side 
confidence for buyers in the voluntary 
carbon market (VCM). 
Since 2022 when we launched the world-
first voluntary carbon credit invalidation 
insurance, we have continued with our 
mission to de-risk and help scale high-
integrity carbon markets. 
In 2024, we announced the first 
carbon credits warranty and indemnity 
(W&I) insurance policy. The policy 
offers insurance-backed guarantees 
that carbon credit buyers will be 
compensated if any social, environmental 
or financial issues arise that compromise 
the integrity of the credits. These 
assurances are incorporated into 
sales contracts, legally outlining the 
expectations for the credits to meet 
market integrity standards. 
The first buyer of the policy applied 
it to credits generated through their 
reafforestation project in Ghana. 
Recognising the value of this insurance 
protection, and the high quality of the 
credits, it provided buy-side confidence 
and allowed the project developers to 
sell the credits at a premium compared to 
other reafforestation projects currently 
offered in the market. 
There is an increasing awareness of the 
global economy’s impact on, and reliance 
upon, nature. Lesser appreciated is the 
central role that insurance can play 
in unlocking and scaling the financial 
resources essential for mitigating and 
adapting to climate change, as well as 
conserving and restoring nature.
Unlocking investment in nature based-solutions
Nature’s crucial role
Examples of unlocking finance for nature
 
Risk transfer

natural assets
•	 Scale use of parametric products
•	 Incentivise habitat restoration through 
resilience insurance
Enabling trading 
in environmental 
markets
•	 Expand insurance coverage for carbon markets
•	 Adapt offerings for other environmental markets
Governance 
•	 Investigate where traditional insurance 
incentivises nature and biodiversity loss

Howden Resilience Laboratory
Using Howden’s broader data and 
technology expertise, the CRR team 
launched the Howden Resilience 
Laboratory (HRL) in collaboration with 
Microsoft. The HRL is a digital hub that 
creates and scales analytical solutions 
to help clients tackle climate challenges.
By working with industry experts, data 
scientists, and Microsoft’s Planetary 
Computer, the HRL models climate 
scenarios and measures their financial 
impact. It turns complex environmental 
and financial data into clear, practical 
insights helping business leaders, 
investors, and asset owners better 
understand and manage climate risks.
Bridging the gap between the 
insurance market and investors
Physical climate risks can reduce the 
value of real assets by affecting revenues, 
increasing operational costs, or making 
insurance harder to obtain. To help 
address this, Howden’s CRR team has 
worked with the Institutional Investors 
Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) to 
understand the challenges investors face 
when integrating physical climate risks 
into their decision making processes. 
At New York Climate Week 2024, Howden 
and Microsoft demonstrated a new 
automated model developed in the HRL. 
This tool helps real asset investors to see 
how physical climate risks could affect 
their portfolios and to evaluate resilience 
strategies while considering their 
financial impact.
Built using the IIGCC’s Physical Climate 
Risk Assessment Methodology (PCRAM), 
it’s the first tool of its kind to include 
financial metrics like cash flow and 
investment returns. 
As the relationship between data and 
analytics, and the impacts of climate change 
and biodiversity loss evolve, we believe the 
need for data-driven insight becomes ever 
more critical. 
Data and technology-led innovation
Turning climate data into action
By streamlining the process, 
the Resilience Laboratory’s 
application of PCRAM offers 
the opportunity to broaden its 
use across sectors, providing 
insurers and investors with 
a practical framework to 
incorporate climate resilience 
into their decision-making. 
This consistent approach not 
only manages risks but also 
enhances asset value over time, 
ensuring long-term stability 
and unlocking opportunities 
for more resilient investments.”

As temperatures rise, the scale and 
impact of climate-related shocks 
rises too, hitting the most vulnerable 
communities the hardest. 
Just as we help clients respond to 
climate risks, we are also focused on 
supporting communities on the frontlines 
of the climate crisis to build resilience, 
through giving them the tools, knowledge 
and confidence to invest in a safer and 
more resilient future. We do this through 
our support of our corporate foundation, 
the Howden Foundation, and separately 
through our support of Humanity Insured. 
Our corporate foundation, Howden 
Foundation, is a strategic philanthropy on 
a mission to equip those most exposed to 
the impacts of climate change, especially 
extreme heat and drought, with the tools 
to prepare, adapt, and recover.
Complementary to this – and in 
recognition of the scale of the challenge 
and the potential for insurance to 
transform the way communities build 
resilience against climate risks, in 
September 2024, Howden brought 
together the insurance sector to launch 
Humanity Insured. Humanity Insured aims 
to transform the insurance system to 
make insurance accessible and effective 
for people on the climate crisis frontline, 
helping them to protect their futures. 
Climate change is a pressing 
crisis that is driving humanitarian 
disasters across the globe.

Howden’s independent Foundation, the 
Howden Foundation, was formed in 2014 
to extend the charitable work of the 
business and its people. 
The Foundation works to empower 
communities around the world who 
are facing the worst impacts of the 
climate crisis to take action to address 
it, such that they can prepare for, adapt 
to and recover from its increasingly 
devastating effects. 
Working in partnership with these 
communities and the organisations that 
know them best, the Howden Foundation 
provides funding, support and technical 
advice wherever it is needed most.
The Foundation also supports causes 
and communities selected by Howden 
employees, and has distributed almost 
£1 million in matched funding to more 
than 600 charities across 21 countries 
since 2021, as well as pledging over 
£250k to more than 100 charities through 
the Howden Foundation Charity Awards.
Protecting livelihoods and lives:
Climate insurance 
for female workers 
in India
In India, rising temperatures are 
making it increasingly difficult for 
informal female workers to safely 
earn a living. The Howden Foundation 
supports Climate Resilience for All’s 
‘Women’s Climate Shock Insurance 
and Livelihood Initiative’ (WCSI), which 
provides financial support and wage 
protection when it becomes too hot 
and dangerous for women to work. The 
programme engaged 50,000 members 
of the Self-Employed Women’s 
Association (SEWA) in its first year, 
providing close to $600,000 in extreme 
heat insurance and cash to those 
involved across Rajasthan, Maharashtra 
and Gujarat. This resulted in increased 
family income and food security; 
increased agency and decision-making 
power; and reduced illness, injury and 
exploitation. Up to 250,000 women are 
expected to participate in the second 
year of the programme. By funding 
scalable, risk-based solutions like WCSI, 
the Howden Foundation is helping 
communities most vulnerable to the 
impacts of climate change to prepare 
for, adapt to and recover from its 
increasingly devastating impacts.

 The evolution of Humanity Insured
 
Over the past few years, Howden has 
been finding ways for insurance to play a 
meaningful role supporting those bearing 
the brunt of a changing climate.
Recognising that, in just over two 
decades1, the difference between 
the amount needed to respond to 
humanitarian crises and the funds 
available had increased by around 30 
times, Howden began working with 
organisations that support and are 
embedded in communities on the climate 
frontline to develop solutions that use 
insurance to unlock private capital, stretch 
donations further, and empower people to 
be financially prepared. 
Making insurance accessible and effective 
for people on the climate crisis frontlines.
1.	 WHO.
Empowering people on the frontlines of the climate crisis
Humanity Insured
Since 2022, Howden has provided 
over $600,000 to support innovative 
pilot projects that provide insurance 
and risk modelling expertise to people 
most exposed to climate disasters, 
helping to make insurance available and 
affordable at scale for climate-vulnerable 
communities.
Howden recognised that this needed to 
be delivered by an independent charity 
that could attract a large pool of private 
and philanthropic donations in order 
to grow at the scale required to have a 
meaningful impact. 
In 2024, having secured the support 
of seven other founding donors 
from the insurance industry – Allianz, 
Hiscox, The Fidelis Partnership, Tokio 
Marine Kiln, AXA XL, Inigo, and Beazley 
– Humanity Insured was launched as an 
independent charity.
Humanity Insured’s mission is to 
stop climate disasters from driving 
poverty among the world’s most 
climate‑vulnerable people by increasing 
their financial preparedness. 
2021
2021-23
2024
At COP26, Barbados’ Prime Minister, 
Mia Mottley, asks, “Where is the 
private sector?”
Inspired, David Howden recognises 
the urgent need for the insurance 
industry to step up and bridge the 
humanitarian funding gap – using 
insurance solutions to connect 
private capital to help those most 
impacted by climate change.
Howden begins establishing an 
independent charity, backed by the 
insurance sector. 
Bringing insurance to those on the 
climate frontline, Howden supports 
pilot projects in India, Belize, the 
Philippines, Jamaica, Rwanda, and Fiji.
In October 2024, Humanity Insured is 
officially launched as an independent 
UK and US registered charity, backed 
by eight founding donors from the 
insurance industry.
Humanity Insured awards five 
grants to grantees including 
UNHCR, One Acre Fund, and WFP, 
protecting over 1 million people from 
climate-related risk.

About Humanity Insured
Humanity Insured is a UK and US charity 
backed by the insurance sector that 
empowers at-risk communities to build 
climate resilience through effective 
insurance solutions. Humanity Insured 
is on a mission to leverage private 
and philanthropic capital at scale to 
unlock insurance protection for the 
3.6 billion people living on the climate 
crisis frontline.
For these people the ever-present 
threat of climate shocks and stresses 
destabilises lives and livelihoods, 
forcing those at-risk into survival mode 
as financial assistance is not reliably 
available and often arrives too late. 
Humanity Insured exists to change this.
It looks to address the urgent need for 
the most vulnerable communities to 
prepare for and protect themselves 
from the devastating impacts of climate 
change, by paying for a portion of 
insurance premiums so the people most 
threatened by climate change have 
an insurance safety net. The financial 
protection insurance provides empowers 
people to invest in everything from 
education to new farming techniques. 
This means failed harvests don’t steal 
childhoods. Sick livestock don’t become 
lost livelihoods. And disasters don’t 
descend into crises. 
UNHCR case study (Malawi)
The Dzaleka refugee settlement in 
Malawi struggles with overcrowding and 
worsening droughts, which threaten 
livelihoods and leave both refugees and 
the local community heavily reliant on aid. 
In a pioneering partnership, Humanity 
Insured and UNHCR have co-funded 
innovative drought insurance to provide 
immediate, guaranteed cash payouts 
before droughts strike, empowering 
refugees and the local community to 
secure food, rebuild livelihoods, and plan 
for the future with dignity.
This partnership is more than a local 
success – it’s a scalable model for 
protecting millions of displaced and 
vulnerable people worldwide, promotes 
peaceful cohabitation, builds a sense of 
security delivering stability, dignity, and 
resilience to those who need it most.
One Acre Fund  
case study (Kenya)
Kenyan smallholder farmers face 
escalating climate disasters that 
devastate crops and livelihoods, 
driving families deeper into poverty. 
In partnership with One Acre Fund, 
Humanity Insured is subsidising Excess 
rainfall, Drought and Area Yield Index 
insurance for 216,554 smallholder 
farmers. This insurance offers payouts 
and loan forgiveness during poor 
harvests, giving farmers the stability 
and confidence to invest in their 
futures – planting seeds, buying farming 
equipment, and keeping their children 
in school. 
This financial protection helps farmers 
move beyond daily survival and build a 
future of resilience, prosperity and hope, 
despite the growing climate crisis.
World Food Programme (WFP) 
case study (Syria)
After more than a decade of conflict, 
Syria faces worsening food insecurity, 
with 13 million people experiencing 
severe hunger2, with the situation made 
worse by droughts.
In response, Humanity Insured has 
partnered with the World Food 
Programme (WFP) to protect 246,000 
Syrians, with a focus on pregnant and 
breastfeeding women. In the event 
of a drought, the insurance provides 
immediate payouts, so that displaced 
people and farmers have access to food 
and preventing malnutrition, offering a 
much-needed lifeline.
This initiative allows reliable, 
non‑politicised funding for WFP’s 
vital work, strengthening the path 
to sustainable food security and 
long-term resilience for Syria’s most 
vulnerable communities.

volunteering 30 hours to running 30km, 
collecting 30 bags of litter, or raising 
£30 for a cause, our people found 
unique ways to amplify their giving. 
This year, we raised more money and 
engaged more colleagues than ever 
before. We raised more than £340,000* 
– more than double the previous year’s 
total – and employees volunteered more

Howden Foundation 
Charity Awards 
In December 2024, the Howden 
Foundation Charity Awards recognised 
and celebrated the outstanding work of 
charities supported by our colleagues. 
These awards highlight the Foundation’s 
focus on amplifying the charitable giving 
of our people by providing additional 
funding to the organisations they care 
about most via its People First Fund. 
All colleagues were invited to nominate 
a charity close to their hearts, and 
eligible charities were then voted on by 
colleagues to decide the winners. The 
Foundation pledged more than £140,000 
in funding to over 60 charities, with 
individual grants ranging from £1,000 
to £30,000. Alzheimer’s Research UK 
secured the top prize of £30,000, and 
colleague Samantha Hicks-Smith, who 
nominated the charity, shared why this 
meant so much.
The Charity Awards reflect our belief 
in empowering our people to support 
causes close to their hearts and 
strengthen communities worldwide. 
Alzheimer’s Research UK is a 
cause incredibly close to my 
heart. My family, like so many 
others, has been affected by 
dementia. It’s the UK’s leading 
cause of death, and there’s still 
no cure – but there is hope. With 
donations like this, the incredible 
scientists at Alzheimer’s Research 
UK can continue their vital work 
towards finding a solution.”

Spotlight on giving back: 
Carlie Norwell
One employee who has gone above 
and beyond to give back to her 
community is Carlie Norwell. 
This year, Carlie dedicated more 
than 2,100 hours of her time to 
volunteering – equivalent to an 
incredible 40 hours per week. 
Through her tireless efforts, she has 
rescued 14,000+ meals from going 
to waste and championed countless 
fundraising initiatives. In recognition of 
her exceptional contributions, Carlie 
was awarded the Giving Back People 
Award at the 2024 Howden Awards, an 
accolade celebrating employees. 
“Giving back has always been a part of 
who I am. Growing up, I experienced 
the support of community initiatives 
first hand, and it inspired me to get 
involved and keep going. I believe that 
if you have the ability to help, you have 
a responsibility to do so. Even small 
actions can make a big difference in 
creating a stronger, better community 
for everyone.”

Three Peaks challenge
In April 2024, our UK employees selected 
Maggie’s as our UK charity partner for the 
next two years. 
Maggie’s provides a unique approach 
to cancer care, offering free financial, 
psychological, and practical support to 
anyone affected by a cancer diagnosis. 
Support is available both online and at 
their 24 centres across the UK. 
As Maggie’s largest corporate partner 
in 2024, our aim is to enable them to 
transform the lives of even more people 
living with cancer and their families. We’ve 
set an ambitious target to raise £500,000 
over the course of our partnership to 
fund their vital support. This amount 
could cover 6,500 financial support 
sessions and 4,000 psychological 
support sessions. These services help 
alleviate the stress and anxiety that often 
accompany a cancer diagnosis.
As of December 2024, we have already 
raised £410,000, including matched 
funding from the Foundation, thanks to 
the incredible fundraising efforts of our 
UK colleagues. With over a year of the 
partnership still to go, we are confident in 
our ability to surpass our target and make 
an even greater impact.
Our partnership with Maggie’s goes 
beyond fundraising. Through our network 
of branches, we are working to raise 
awareness of Maggie’s and we are 
collaborating to develop cancer-friendly 
insurance, challenging the insurance 
industry to better meet the needs of 
people living with cancer.
 	Learn more about Maggie’s 
and their work
I nominated Maggie’s to be our 
UK charity partner because of 
my sister Josie’s experience. 
Diagnosed with a rare form 
of cancer at 30, she found an 
escape at Maggie’s during a time 
of great fear and uncertainty. 
Their support extended 
beyond Josie, offering comfort 
to our entire family during this 
difficult time.”

Community impact
DUAL ANZ – a culture of giving back 
In 2024 alone, DUAL ANZ raised an 
impressive A$639,000 (£320,400) for 
over 286 charities and contributed 
1,876 volunteer hours. Remarkably, they 
accounted for almost a quarter of our 
global fundraising efforts for the second 
consecutive year.
This year, to celebrate DUAL ANZ’s 20th 
anniversary, the team organised a series 
of signature fundraising events across 
Australia. These events raised significant 
funds for a variety of causes, including 
A$50,000 for Ocean Heroes in Perth, 
A$72,000 for Eat Up in Melbourne, and 
A$127,000 for the Black Dog Institute 
across Sydney and Brisbane. 
Under the leadership of CEO Damien 
Coates, giving back has become 
embedded in DUAL ANZ’s culture. 
Damien’s passion for mental health 
advocacy has been a driving force, both 
within the business and beyond. As an 
ambassador for the Black Dog Institute, 
a leading mental health charity in the 
region, Damien has shared his mental 
health workshops with over 10,000 
people and led DUAL ANZ in raising over 
A$1 million for the charity since their 
partnership began. In recognition of his 
trailblazing contributions, Damien was 
awarded the inaugural Howden Group 
Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2024 
Howden Awards.
DUAL Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), 
comprising just over 1% of our global headcount – 
but accounting for almost a quarter of our global 
fundraising – exemplifies how a focus on giving back 
can achieve extraordinary results. 
For every hour of volunteering an employee 
does, we donate A$50 to their group giving 
account, enabling them to support the causes 
closest to their hearts. While mental health 
charities are my personal focus, our people are 
passionate about a wide range of issues, from 
animal welfare to climate action and poverty 
alleviation. By recognising their efforts and 
supporting their passions, we’ve fostered a 
culture where giving back isn’t just encouraged 
– it’s celebrated.”

A people-first culture
Empowering people from all walks of life 
to build fulfilling careers by making Howden 
a great place to work. 
People come to Howden for lots of 
different reasons, but they all stay 
for the same one: our culture. It’s what 
sets us apart.
Since 1994, we have been employee-
owned and have always been driven by 
an entrepreneurial spirit. Right from the 
beginning, we’ve focused on attracting 
talented individuals and empowering 
them to make a real difference, whilst 
building successful and fulfilling careers 
at the same time. 
We have a noticeably flat hierarchy 
for a global organisation of such 
size and scope. It comes from the 
way the group has grown over the 
last 30 years, with mergers with 
like-minded companies done in a spirit 
of collaborative independence. 
We believe our business succeeds by 
allowing our people to make a mark 
in the areas they care about most: 
personal development, volunteering 
and fundraising for charity, or creating 
new insurance products that address 
society’s greatest challenges.
Prioritising wellbeing 
We believe enabling our colleagues 
to balance and enhance their overall 
wellbeing is central to our culture. 
Having the opportunity to engage in 
wellbeing activities flexibly, whether 
individually or in groups, virtually or in 
person, gives our colleagues the freedom 
to build wellbeing into their working 
and personal lives according to their 
circumstances.
Wellbeing is a cornerstone of a thriving 
culture because it directly influences 
employee satisfaction, productivity, 
and retention. When individuals 
feel their physical, psychological, 
emotional, and social needs are met, 
they are more engaged. It creates a 
supportive and inclusive environment 
where colleagues can be their best. 
It encourages open communication, 
reduces stress, and helps to prevent 
burnout, having significant impacts on 
both the individual, their peers but also 
more widely the business.
Wellbeing is not just about work; it 
extends to the personal lives of our 
colleagues as well. By supporting our 
employees in managing their overall 
wellbeing, we help them lead more 
balanced and fulfilling lives. This holistic 
approach can allow colleagues to care for 
their families, pursue personal interests, 
and enjoy a higher quality of life.
We are focused to providing the 
resources and support needed to help 
them thrive both professionally and 
personally. We provide and promote a 
variety of forums, webinars, live events, 
and tools that support psychological, 
emotional, financial, and social wellbeing. 
Howden also provides virtual counselling 
for anyone that needs additional support.

To be a great global business that talent, 
clients and partners love, we know that 
we must work every day to grow and 
evolve a culture that prioritises the 
wellbeing and success of our people by 
creating a workplace where everyone is 
valued, respected, and empowered to 
contribute their best.
Locally driven, globally aligned
To support accountability and to drive 
meaningful change from leadership, we 
have established divisional and regional 
D&I committees, all reporting into the 
Group D&I committee. This structure 
promotes that responsibility for driving 
progress sits at the right levels across 
the business, promoting accountability 
and action.   
The Group D&I committee, a sub-
committee of the board, is responsible 
for supporting regulatory compliance 
while providing guidance, support, 
and challenge to regional and divisional 
D&I efforts.    
Divisional and regional committees 
play a crucial role in aligning D&I plans 
and initiatives with business strategies, 
driving data collection, and tracking 
performance. By partnering with global 
and local HR teams, they foster regional 
engagement and compliance with local 
regulations, further embedding D&I into 
our daily operations.   
We are focused on making Howden a 
great place to work for people from all 
walks of life. 
Growing an inclusive and empowered culture
A people-first culture

Employee Resource 
Groups (ERGs)
Our employee membership for our 11 
ERGs, which are open to all employees, 
has grown to 1,525, with over 1,300 
colleagues attending ERG events over 
the past year. In 2024, we launched 
two new ERGs – ‘RESPECT: Service 
Network’ supporting military-connected 
employees and their families, and a 
standalone ‘RESPECT: Neurodiversity’ 
ERG. Our global expansion continues, 
with the first ERGs launched outside 
the UK.
Employee round tables
Building on the success of our diversity 
roundtables, this year we’ve created 
more forums for employees to engage in 
discussions that inspire curiosity, deepen 
understanding and drive change. So 
far, over 500 employees across the UK 
and Asia have participated in sessions 
covering topics like racial equality, social 
mobility, and neurodiversity.
Career returners initiative
Through our partnerships with Career 
Returners and the Insurance Families 
Network, we are helping those who take 
a career break to return to roles that 
match their skills and experience. These 
initiatives reduce pay penalties, normalise 
flexible working for all, and support 
fair progression.
Parental Leave Support 
In collaboration with our Parents at Work 
ERG, we’ve developed comprehensive 
parental leave guides for both managers 
and employees. These resources share 
best practice and actionable tools to 
support a smoother transition and 
greater support for parents returning 
to work. 
Menopause Champions
We have launched Menopause 
Champions across the UK to improve 
workplace support. These champions 
serve as advocates and first points of 
contact, helping to reduce stigma and 
foster positive change.
Everywoman in 
Insurance Forum
We continue to sponsor the Everywoman 
in Insurance Forum – which brought 
together more than 500 women this 
year. It provides access to role models, 
fosters discussion, and builds supportive 
networks to encourage the attraction and 
development of women in insurance. 
Our focus on harnessing the collective 
talents and perspectives of our people is 
brought to life in different ways around 
the world; here are some examples.

Reasonable adjustment process
To give every individual the tools they 
need to excel, we partnered with our 
Disability and Neurodiversity ERGs to 
revamp our reasonable adjustment 
process and create an environment 
where everyone can thrive.
Dive In Festival
In 2024, we supported the Dive In 
Festival, the insurance industry’s leading 
D&I event. Howden hosted sessions 
across the UK, Singapore, Brazil, 
Colombia, Italy, Japan, Australia, and New 
Zealand, covering critical topics such as 
women’s career phases, social mobility, 
empowering neurodiverse talent, and 
supporting intellectual disabilities.
Our sessions were attended by 3,816 
people, and our Three Phases of a Woman’s 
Career event was the most attended 
session of the entire global festival.
The King’s Trust partnership
For the past three years, we have 
partnered with The King’s Trust and 
LIIBA to deliver the Get Into Insurance 
programme – an initiative designed 
to give 18 to 30 year-olds from 
underrepresented backgrounds an 
introduction to the insurance industry 
and a pathway to a successful career.
The programme provides a two-week 
intensive course covering key topics and 
hands-on, practical work experience, 
equipping them with the knowledge and 
skills to explore a career in our industry. In 
2024, nine participants went on to secure 
an internship or apprenticeship in various 
areas of the business.
Inclusive Futures Coalition
We are proud to be a founding partner of 
the Inclusive Futures Coalition, a bold ten- 
year initiative, focused on transforming 
the insurance industry’s talent landscape. 
Through targeted bursaries and inclusive 
recruitment partnerships, we are actively 
broadening our reach to attract Black and 
ethnically diverse talent.
This initiative is not just about filling 
roles – it’s about reshaping the future of 
our industry to reflect the communities 
we serve.
A people-first culture
Broker D&I 
Champion Award
In 2024 we were proud to win the 
Broker D&I Champion Award at the 
UK Broker Awards. This achievement 
reflects the collective effort of so 
many people across Howden – our 
D&I team, our ERGs, the 3,000+ 
colleagues who pledged to make 
a difference through the All of 
Us campaign, and the voluntary 
committees driving our inclusive 
culture worldwide. 
This recognition is a testament to our 
people-first culture and our focus on 
turning words into action. Together, 
we’re building a workplace and an 
industry where everyone belongs.

Some of our All of Us pledges 
from around the world: 
Taking action
All of Us
In our two-year All of Us pledge 
campaign, which concluded in October 
2024, colleagues across 43 countries 
submitted more than 3,300 pledges to 
make a difference. 
Pledges focused on improving 
representation, creating opportunities 
for growth, and cultivating a sense of 
belonging that we can all be proud of. 
They included everything from 
partnering with schools and 
charities to promote insurance as a 
career and create opportunities for 
young people from disadvantaged 
backgrounds, to establishing and 
expanding mentoring and knowledge 
exchange programmes, to broadening 
perspectives and understanding 
through hosting roundtables and 
awareness-building events. 
We also launched the All of Us online 
library, where over 500 colleagues from 
32 countries borrowed e-books on topics 
such as understanding neurodiversity, 
demystifying disability, and achieving 
work-life balance. 
All of Us began with a bold vision: to 
inspire teams and individuals to take 
action to make this a great place to 
work for people from all walks of life. 
Jess Moylan, Singapore
Group Communications  
Director – APAC
Jess pledged to launch the Knowledge 
Exchange programme in Asia Pacific and

12 countries and 17 different businesses. 
Sam Vardy, UK

Underwriting Chief Officer & 
Financial Lines Manager
Eva Maria pledged to give opportunities 
within the underwriting team to young

Assistant Manager
Sheryl pledged to do her bit in fostering 
and maintaining an inclusive working 
environment by completing unconscious 
bias training and building greater 
self‑awareness.
Sam Johnston, UK
Senior HR Business Partner 
Sam pledged to continue his role as an 
Alumni mentor to Black students from his 
former university. Encouraging students 
to consider a role in HR/Insurance 
through sharing his experiences and 
support during recruitment processes.
Ian McLauchlan, Australia
DUAL ANZ CFO 
Ian McLauchlan also pledged to raise 
awareness of neurodiversity which 
contributed to the launch of the ANZ 
Disability and Neurodiversity employee 
resource group.

CEO Consumer and Local Commercial
Kelly was one of the first leaders to 
make a pledge, aiming to connect all 110 
Howden retail branches across the UK 
with local schools, colleges, sixth forms 
and careers hubs. As part of a business-
wide initiative to attract talent from all 
walks of life, this pledge aimed to raise 
awareness of the insurance industry 
and the exciting opportunities available 
to young people. 
Throughout the All of Us campaign, 
the branch network engaged over 130 
schools, delivering presentations, careers 
fairs, and apprenticeship sessions, 
reaching more than 11,500 students. 
The team also developed a dedicated 
work experience programme, providing 
35 young people with hands-on insight 
into the day-to-day life of an insurance 
broker. In recognition of her leadership 
in driving this initiative, Kelly was awarded 
The Insurance Times Industry Achiever

Measuring our 
employee engagement 
We offer colleagues different forums to 
share thoughts and opinions including 
through ERGs and listening forums. To 
help us assess and monitor employee 
satisfaction and engagement, we 
welcome colleagues to participate in our 
global people survey, giving everyone the 
opportunity to provide feedback on their 
experience of working at Howden. 
As we continue to grow as a business, 
it is important that we understand what 
matters to our people the most, so we 
equip leaders with the knowledge to 
drive improve and remain aligned with the 
goals and values of Howden.
During our latest Employee Engagement 
Survey (March 2024), 82 per cent of 
colleagues responded providing key 
insights into our global employee 
experience. Our overall engagement 
score has risen to 8.0 out of 10, marking 
a 0.5 increase since our previous survey, 
while our employer net promoter score 
(eNPS) stands at +40 per cent. The most 
positively rated statements were: “People 
from all backgrounds are treated fairly at 
Howden” and “I understand what it means 
to be a responsible business”, reinforcing 
that our core values resonate at all levels 
of the organisation.
Gender pay gap 
Reducing our gender pay gap is a long-
term commitment, and we recognise that 
meaningful change takes time.
While the increase in our gap reflects 
more women represented in the lower 
pay quartiles, we are confident that 
our continued focus on development 
and progression will help drive lasting 
improvement.
We remain focused on fostering a 
workplace where everyone has the 
opportunity to grow, succeed, and be 
rewarded fairly. 
Headcount
Since the snapshot data of the 2023 
report, Howden has seen a significant rise 
in headcount of 2,049. 
New hires
New hires represent the majority of 
the additional headcount but also 
reflects acquisitions who have moved 
to the Howden entity during the 
snapshot period.

Embedding sustainability across our operations
We are continuously working to integrate 
sustainable practices across our 
business, so that our growth aligns with 
our environmental responsibility. As 
regulations evolve, we remain proactive in 
implementing solutions that reduce and 
offset our environmental impact.
Net zero by 2040 
In 2024, we calculated our greenhouse 
gas emissions using 2023 as our 
baseline. We are focused on achieving 
net zero across our buildings, transport, 
and purchased goods and services1,2 by 
20403. Our emissions reduction targets 
are currently aligned with climate science 
aimed at limiting global warming to 1.5°C 
above pre-industrial levels.
Our Sustainability and Climate Advisory 
teams are working with businesses 
across Howden to develop a transition 
plan that outlines the necessary actions 
and governance frameworks to enable us 
to meet our net-zero target.4,5 
Greenhouse gas emissions and 
energy usage 
We calculate our operational emissions 
in line with the GHG Protocol, leveraging 
Salesforce’s Net Zero Cloud software 
as our carbon accounting platform. This 
tool enables us to address the challenges 
and complexities of collecting and 
managing data within a decentralised 
operating model.
Since establishing our global greenhouse 
gas emissions baseline in 2023, we have 
continued to enhance our data collection 
efforts across Howden entities, helping 
so that our figures accurately reflect 
our ongoing business growth both 
organically and through acquisitions 
in 2024. 
As our business has expanded, our 
employee headcount has increased, 
influencing our overall emissions profile. 
To further enhance transparency and 
credibility, we have also initiated third-
party verification of our emissions data 
and calculations.
Like many professional services 
organisations, the majority of our 
emissions fall into Scope 3, including 
but not limited to business travel, 
purchased goods and services, waste 
generated in our operations, and 
employee commuting.
Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, 
we will continue exploring further 
opportunities to reduce our global 
emissions while enhancing our data 
collection efforts for purchased goods 
and services.
Energy efficiency actions
In the UK, we have appointed a new 
energy management service provider 
to take a more holistic approach to 
improving energy management across 
our UK operations. Through this 
partnership, we are reviewing how we 
purchase energy and adopting a more 
coordinated approach to collecting 
and managing our utility data. This 
will enhance the reliability of our 
emission data, enabling us to measure 
environmental performance more 
effectively, and prioritise improvements 
to minimise our impact.
Our newly refurbished offices in 
Manchester and Milton Keynes have 
been awarded SKA Silver and Gold 
Certifications, respectively. A sustainable 
building assessment standard, SKA is 
designed specifically for building fit-out 
and refurbishment projects. It recognises 
efforts across a range of good practice 
measures, including reducing energy 
use and carbon emissions, reducing 
waste, and enhancing wellbeing through 
thoughtful design. 
Despite the challenges of working 
with a historically complex building in 
Manchester, both renovation project 
teams were committed to implementing 
sustainable and efficient solutions. 
Manchester’s certification was supported 
by low-carbon measures such as the 
installation of electric heating systems; 
LED lighting systems linked to occupancy 
and daylight sensors, eco-friendly paints 
and varnishes with low VOCs to improve 
indoor air quality, diverting construction 
waste from landfill to improve recycling 
rates, and engaging with suppliers 
on take-back schemes. Across both 
sites, we focused on minimising the 
life cycle impact of materials, reducing 
waste through thoughtful design, and 
incorporating energy-efficient lighting 
linked to office occupancy.
Across our other UK offices, we have 
also replaced HVAC units with the latest 
energy-efficient models, improving 
overall efficiency and building controls. 
Additionally, we continue to upgrade 
existing incandescent lighting with 
energy-efficient LEDs throughout our 
UK estate.
We recognise our responsibility in 
addressing environmental challenges. 
As a global business operating in more 
than 50 countries, we are working 
to embed sustainability at the core 
of our operations – minimising our 
impact on the climate and protecting 
our natural environment.
Our approach to operational environmental sustainability 
1.	 Scope 1 and 2 emissions cover 95% of the total 
emissions from these categories across Howden. 
2.	 Scope 3 emissions covered in the target include 
only waste, purchased goods and services and 
travel.
3.	 Howden will use 2023 operational emissions as the 
baseline for measuring progress.
4.	 Emissions related to broking transactions are 
excluded from this target.
5.	 The scope of the target will be reviewed periodically 
to assess applicability and emission category 
materiality.

Carbon offset projects
Supporting projects 
across the world
Case study
In 2024, we reviewed our carbon offset 
strategy and adopted elements of 
the Oxford Principles, a recognised 
framework for creating offset strategies 
that have meaningful impact. As a result, 
we increased both the geographical and 
technological diversity of our portfolio 
and placed a heightened emphasis 
on increasing the number of carbon 
removal projects that make up our 
portfolio. Additionally, we have selected 
projects that also provide biodiversity 
and socio-economic benefits to the 
surrounding communities. 
Lauder Common Project
Lauder Common, Scotland
In Scotland, we are supporting a project that 
involves planting 22 hectares of mostly native 
woodlands in a previously unforested area. 
Alongside carbon removal, this undertaking 
aims to improve biodiversity in the area 
through intervention management of 
native species.
Terrawatt 
Spain
Terrawatt is a company pioneering an 
innovative pyrolysis and methanisation plant 
in Spain with the aim of maximising the value 
of biomass waste by producing biochar, a 
carbon-rich material that sequesters carbon 
for hundreds to thousands of years.
Conhuas
Ejido Conhuas, Mexico
Based within a biological and hydrological 
priority region, this project focuses on 
afforestation and reforestation activities. 
By supporting this project, we aim to help 
enhance carbon sequestration in the 
area, restoring degraded ecosystems 
and promoting sustainable land use while 
conserving biodiversity. 
Carbono Forestal Ejido Pueblo
Sierra Madra Occidental, Mexico
Within the Sierra Madra Occidental mountain 
range in Mexico, we are supporting an 
initiative that aims to enhance forest 
growth, mitigate disturbance risks, and 
boost the economic viability of forestry 
for local communities. Through fostering 
forest growth and extending the rotation 
age of trees, this project aims to enhance 
carbon sequestration. 
Benban
Egypt
This project generates clean electricity, 
helping to address Egypt’s electricity 
shortages and exposure to volatile natural 
gas prices, while contributing to climate 
change mitigation through a clean and 
diverse energy mix. The project creates job 
opportunities both during the construction 
phase and during ongoing operations. 
Tradewater 
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
Tradewater focuses on the collection, control, 
and responsible destruction of substances 
banned 40 years ago under the Montreal 
Protocol, but which were not disposed of. 
These substances have the potential to 
release powerful greenhouse gases, so 
preventing their release into the atmosphere 
through responsible destruction is crucial.
Delta Blue Mangrove Restoration 
Pakistan
For the second year in a row, we are 
supporting the world’s largest blue carbon 
project. Spanning 350,000 hectares of tidal 
wetlands, the project aims to protect and 
restores critical mangrove ecosystems, 
serving as a powerful natural carbon sink, 
while safeguarding coastal biodiversity.
Kuamut Forest Conservation Project
Sabah, Malaysia
This conservation project protects more 
than 80,000 hectares of tropical forest 
ecosystems. Eight surrounding villages are 
directly benefiting from receiving training, 
employment, and sustainable economic 
opportunities through improved access to 
non-timber forest products, improved water 
quality, and eco-tourism. 
Carboneers Biochar
Odisha and the Assam regions, India
This carbon removal project provides farmers 
with the technology and training to convert 
biomass into biochar. Biochar provides a 
carbon sink for over 1,000 years, and is used 
by farmers as a fertiliser to boost yields and 
aid in climate adaptivity by increasing the 
water-holding capacity of their land.

Waste management
Optimising our waste practices 
462,133kg 
of plastic waste removed  
from the seas over four years
1,500
total employees engaged
Seven Clean Seas
Our partnership with Seven Clean Seas 
has been instrumental in scaling our 
efforts to combat plastic pollution and 
support community development. Since 
2020, what began as a beach clean-up 
initiative has evolved into a structured, 
large-scale programme that drives both 
environmental and social impact. 
In 2024, our support contributed to the 
removal of 462,133kg (462 tonnes) of 
plastic waste, significantly increasing 
the impact of Seven Clean Seas’ 
operations. Beyond waste removal, their 
work continues to create meaningful 
employment opportunities, with 106 
waste collectors now in formal, ethical 
jobs – providing stable income, social 
security, and healthcare benefits for 
underserved communities. Whilst Seven 
Clean Seas are supported by multiple 
partners, Howden is proud to be one 
of the largest funders helping to enable 
this growth. 
Restore UK
In the UK, we have partnered with 
Restore plc to reuse or recycle our old 
IT equipment. Through this partnership, 
we have saved over 11,877.74 kWh – the 
equivalent of the average annual energy 
supply of 2,160 homes. 
With funding from the Howden 
Foundation, amongst others, Seven Clean 
Seas has also launched a new innovation 
to tackle river plastic pollution at scale – 
the High Impact Plastic Pollution Remover 
(HIPPO). Powered by solar energy, the 
HIPPO has the capacity to remove up to 
1.4 million kilos of waste each year from 
the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, one 
of the world’s most polluted waterways. 
This marks a significant step in stopping 
plastic at source before it reaches the 
ocean, with plans for further HIPPOs to be 
deployed in high-risk locations globally. 
By visiting project sites in Indonesia and 
Thailand, we have seen first-hand the 
impact of this work – not just in cleaning 
the environment but in building long‑term, 
sustainable livelihoods.

We remain focused on a holistic waste 
management approach, actively 
supporting reduction initiatives both 
within and beyond our organisation. 
Globally, we encourage our employees, 
suppliers, and the landlords of our rented 
office spaces to take meaningful steps 
towards reducing waste.

Governance, ethics and compliance
Policy goals
The group’s Principles of Business has 
been embedded across the organisation 
for several years. This incorporates 
the agreed minimum standards 
and ways of working, applicable to 
all entities regardless of size and 
jurisdiction. This includes core policies 
such as anti-bribery and corruption, 
whistleblowing, and financial crime, 
to name a few. 
Local entities are responsible for 
reviewing the group’s Principles for 
Business and Policies and incorporating 
them into their policies and monitoring 
processes. Issues are escalated by 
exception through the relevant risk 
committee which ultimately are reported 
as risk events in the Group ERICCA 
committee and Group Risk committee 
if considered significant to the group. 
Evidence of this reporting is available 
in the packs and minutes of these 
two committees.
To promote a focus on future growth 
and strategic targets, our group-wide 
policy framework is currently undergoing 
enhancement with the introduction of a 
Policy Hub (repository for access to all 
group policies), and additional training 
support from third party providers. 
Compliance training is set and overseen 
at a local level by compliance/HR 
functions across the group, with content 
tailored to the applicable local legal/ 
regulatory context.
Financial crime 
Howden has a zero-tolerance approach 
to all types of financial crime including 
bribery and corruption. The controls in 
place include a group-level minimum 
standards policy, trading entity policies 
and procedures, annual mandatory online 
training for all staff, client screening to 
identify sanctions, PEP and adverse 
media exposure, financial crime risk 
assessment, whistleblowing policy and 
anonymous speak-up call service. We 
require the full registration of all given 
and received gifts and entertainment 
with compliance oversight as well as 
compliance oversight and approval of all 
charitable and corporate donations. 
Human rights and labour rights
At Howden, we believe that respecting 
human rights and labour rights is not 
just a legal obligation but a moral 
imperative. Recognising the importance 
and advancement of human rights as an 
issue is integral to our core business and 
operations as a global employer.
We aim to adhere to the highest 
standards of human rights and labour 
rights, supporting fair and ethical 
treatment of all our employees and 
stakeholders. Our focus is grounded 
in the principles contained within the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and the International Labour Organization 
Core Conventions on Labour Standards.
Guiding actions with integrity and oversight 
We embed ethical and 
responsible policies, processes 
and processes into daily 
operations, empowering our 
people to exceed high standards 
of integrity.
Risk management 
Howden is a large and diverse 
organisation, which increasingly faces 
a broad range of risks affecting various 
aspects of its businesses, which could 
impact financial results, reputational 
image, operations or strategic 
decisions, to name a few. In order to 
achieve management’s objectives and 
expectations for the business, it is 
necessary to manage its risks effectively 
whilst striving to preserve value through a 
robust risk management framework. 
A Group Risk Management framework 
has been established and is being 
embedded, seeking to identify and 
monitor pertinent risks across the 
organisation, supporting informed 
decision-making, and so that appropriate 
internal controls are designed to 
mitigate the downside and maximise 
the potential upside of risks. Under the 
framework, reporting entities will align 
their identified risks to a standardised 
Group Risk Library, from which key risks 
are consolidated and reported upwards 
to the group board via the Group Risk 
committee on a quarterly basis.
The Group Risk Committee is responsible 
for overseeing the organisation’s 
significant risk exposures and the 
associated actions taken by management 
to monitor and mitigate these risks, 
where possible. This includes the risk 
events escalation and horizon risk 
identification process. 
ESG risks
The ESG & Sustainability committee 
sits under the board to advise on ESG 
risks. This committee is supported by 
management representatives from 
multiple business areas, divisions 
and specialist skillsets to review 
and challenge the group’s stance 
on significant ESG related risks.

We strictly prohibit the use of forced 
labour, child labour, slavery, and human 
trafficking in any form. We maintain 
zero tolerance for any practices that 
compromise the dignity and rights 
of individuals. 
To protect labour rights, we provide a safe 
and healthy working environment and 
promote fair wages. We are dedicated 
to fostering inclusion, prohibiting any 
form of discrimination, and supporting 
equal opportunities for all employees 
irrespective of their background.
Our whistleblowing policy encourages 
employees to report any concerns related 
to human rights violations or unethical 
practices without fear of retaliation. 
We have established clear channels 
for addressing grievances and so that 
remedial actions are taken promptly.
To date, no infringements on human 
rights have been reported. However, 
any human rights risk identified would 
be escalated through the appropriate 
governance channels to address and 
remedy. We continually review and 
update our human rights and labour 
rights policies to align with evolving 
global standards and best practices.
Governance, ethics and compliance
Whistleblowing
As an employee-led organisation, the 
business takes any form of wrongdoing 
very seriously. The wellbeing and integrity 
of our employees and business is of 
paramount importance to us and for 
that reason, we encourage all individuals 
to raise any concerns that they may 
have about the conduct of others in the 
business or the way in which the business 
is run. 
As part of our whistleblowing reporting 
process, we use Safecall, a global, 
independent and confidential reporting 
service. Safecall provides a completely 
confidential service to individuals 
who wish to raise any concerns they 
have, if for any reason they are unable 
to do so with their line manager in 
the first instance. Contact details 
are also available via the company 
website, for external third parties or 
counterparties, e.g. customers, suppliers 
and business partners.
The Group Chief Risk Officer provides 
a formal report to the Group Board and 
Group Risk Committee on at least an 
annual basis, as to the status and themes 
from all whistleblowing cases raised. 
Supply chain management
Our focus to being a responsible 
business extends to our supply chain 
and sourcing activities. Given the nature 
of our operations and our geographical 
spread, we employ a decentralised 
procurement model that leverages local 
buying and operational team members. 
Each business is managed locally, 
with tailored policies and procedures 
that comply with relevant regulations 
and practices, allowing for effective 
management of our operations 
and suppliers. 
To achieve our sustainability goals, we 
work with a trusted network of strategic 
delivery partners and vendors whose 
sustainability priorities align with 
ours. By working with those focused 
on developing sustainable products, 
enhancing energy efficiency, and driving 
the transition to clean energy, we can 
effectively mitigate the impacts of 
climate change. 
We have continued to roll out our vendor 
risk management tool to evaluate vendor 
engagements and identify vendors 
for further third-party monitoring and 
due diligence questionnaires. Since its 
inception, over 350 vendors have been 
and continue to be monitored via our 
VRM tool, and more than 150 of these 
have been issued DDQs for completion.

Cyber security 
Incident management response 
We have a well-defined and practiced 
incident-response plan, allowing for 
prompt response to any suspicious 
activity, initial triaging, investigation 
and resolution, ending with ‘lessons 
learned’ activities, so that any 
resulting improvements are made 
to mitigate reoccurrence.
In conjunction with the incident 
management process, detailed 
instructions are in place to deal with the 
varying types of cyber incidents that have 
been identified via a risk-based approach. 
They fall into the following categories:
•	 Network service attacks
•	 Digital threat attacks
•	 Endpoint protection attacks
•	 End user triggered attacks
•	 External breaches
Cyber risk management
Our proactive risk management approach 
covers management of technical risks 
leveraging advanced threat management 
tools, continuous monitoring, and 
technical scanning – ensuring 
vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated 
before they can be exploited.
Via our third-party management risk 
processes, we enforce stringent security 
requirements for vendors and partners 
ensuring their systems align with our 
own cyber security standards from 
service introduction and BAU service to 
offboarding at relationship end. 
Howden’s Group IT division also directly 
links into the businesses enterprise 
governance risk framework so that 
senior leaders are aware of cyber issues 
and information.
Security certifications
Our security certifications, including ISO 
27001:2022, Cyber Essentials, and PCI 
DSS, mean that we regularly check in with 
ourselves to ensure these high standards 
are maintained and continuously 
improved upon, and allow us to tangibly 
demonstrate this to our stakeholders.
Training and awareness
Human error is always one of the biggest 
threats and is a leading cause of cyber 
incidents. Understanding this, we 
maintain a comprehensive cyber security 
training programme for our people. 
•	 All employees receive mandatory 
cyber security training throughout the 
year, alongside data protection and 
corporate governance training. 
•	 Phishing campaigns targeting all users 
are held at regular intervals across the 
group and the results are monitored 
and remedied.
•	 We hold cyber awareness weeks and 
publicise cyber security protocols 
around our offices via different 
business communications methods. 
Governance
Our cyber security strategy, 
management, and programmes are under 
the direction of the Howden Group Chief 
Information Security Officer (CISO). 
The CISO reports to the Group CIO. The 
CIO and CISO provide regular updates 
on the status of cyber security to our 
Group Leadership team, and quarterly 
to members of the Audit committee. 
We also run a quarterly Cyber and Data 
Oversight committee with a detailed 
review of security and data protection 
risks and programmes. We have defined 
a group cyber security standard control 
framework which is used to assess the 
maturity of our companies globally, with 
a scoring metric reviewed at the audit 
and risk committee level to ensure that all 
companies are maintaining the standard. 
We are externally audited annually by 
our private equity investors as well as 
our external auditor EY and our ISO 
Certification Body.
Our approach to AI 
The use of AI across all industries 
is growing, and so that Howden is 
responsive to the latest wave of this 
technology and its risks, we published an 
AI policy at the end of 2024. This group 
AI Policy aims to balance the benefits 
of AI with potential risk to Howden, its 
employees, assets and reputation, while 
promoting understanding and adherence 
to applicable laws and best practices. 
We understand that employees use 
AI to help them execute certain work-
related tasks, and we expect this usage 
to only increase. Approved tools are 
key to our policy, and offer employees 
safe and secure technology options, 
that have been subject to review and 
risk assessment. 
Governance will be a key focus for 2025 
as we move into the newly regulated 
AI landscape. The EU AI Act brings 
new considerations for the business 
on our approach and priorities for AI 
governance. With our business spanning 
the world, the EU AI Act will be an 
important piece of legislation that will 
shape how we approach AI risk. 
We are optimistic around the 
opportunities AI can offer our business, 
particularly when looking at Howden’s 
growth strategy. We are seeing demand 
across the business, from use cases that 
support and enhance activities in our 
broking functions, to use cases which are 
driving efficiency in operations.
Safeguarding our digital ecosystem
Cyber security and 
protection of our 
data and assets is 
one of our highest 
priorities, so that 
we deliver our 
services securely 
and provide 
our clients and 
stakeholders 
the confidence 
they need. 
Cyber security 
Investing in technologies which help 
mature our security approach and 
increase governance and operational 
resilience is an ongoing process 
so that we maintain a strong cyber 
security posture.
Our cyber security framework
Our cyber strategy is based on strong 
governance and policy management, 
with a continual focus on risk and threat 
management, including proactive 
mitigation, carefully designed technical 
systems and controls, good cyber 
hygiene, and a well‑defined and practiced 
incident-response plan.
We take a holistic approach to cyber 
protection. We understand that there 
is much more to cyber protection and 
understand that there is much more to it 
than just security tooling. None-the-less, 
good deployment of these tools and their 
tuning ensures all other components of 
our cyber security defences are in place.
Our security technology
•	 Endpoint protection: advanced 
anti-malware, intrusion detection, 
and response systems.
•	 Encryption: industry-standard 
encryption protocols to secure data 
in transit and at rest.
•	 Network security: firewalls, secure 
gateways, to minimise unauthorised 
access.
•	 Proactive vulnerability management: 
this ensures our environment is 
always up to date with the latest 
patches deployed.

without notice. Except as required by law, 
Howden does not undertake to update 
any such information in this report, 
whether as a result of new information, 
future events, or otherwise. While 
reasonable care has been taken to ensure 
that the facts stated are fair, clear, and 
not misleading, Howden does not warrant 
or represent (expressly or impliedly) the 
accuracy, completeness, or fitness for 
purpose or use of any information in 
this report. Any opinions expressed may 
be subject to change without notice. 
Howden accepts no liability whatsoever 
for any direct, indirect, or consequential 
loss or damage arising out of the use of 
all or any of the data or information in 
this report. No part of this document may 
be redistributed, copied, or reproduced 
without prior written consent of Howden.
Any references to ‘sustainability’, ‘ESG’, 
or similar terms in this report are intended 
as references to the internally defined 
criteria of Howden only, as applicable, and 
not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory 
definition. There is a lack of harmonisation 
globally in relation to sustainability, and 
regulatory reform may lead to a risk of 
fragmentation as a result of the differing 
pace of the sustainability transition across 
jurisdictions, which may also impact the 
approach that Howden is required to 
take in this area. Howden’s approach to 
the inclusion of information in this report 
differs from disclosures included in 
mandatory regulatory reporting.
While this report may describe events, 
including potential future events, that 
may be significant, any significance 
does not necessarily equate to the level 
of materiality of disclosures required 
under applicable laws. This report is not 
intended to, nor can it be relied upon 
to, create any legal relations, rights, 
or obligations.
The goals, targets, and commitments 
discussed in this report are aspirational. 
As such, no guarantees or promises are 
made that any such goals, targets, or 
commitments will be met. In addition, 
Howden’s ability to measure many of its 
goals and targets is dependent on data 
or estimates that, in some instances, is 
measured, tracked, and provided by its 
clients, other stakeholders, and third-
party data providers; Howden’s ability 
to measure progress toward its goals 
and targets is subject to the quality and 
availability of such data, and estimates. 
Numerous factors could cause Howden’s 
actual results to differ materially 
from those described, including the 
potential impact of legal and regulatory 
obligations, changes in circumstances, 
and assumptions not being realised .
This report does not and should not be 
deemed to constitute an advertisement 
or marketing of Howden’s products 
and/or services or an advertisement to 
the public. No reports, documents, or 
websites that are cited or referred to in 
this report shall be deemed to form part 
of this report. Information contained 
in this report has been obtained from 
sources, including those publicly 
available, believed to be reliable, but no 
representation or warranty is made by 
Howden as to the quality, completeness, 
accuracy, fitness for a particular purpose, 
or non-infringement of such information. 
Howden is not under any obligation to 
verify or validate third-party information 
used in this report and is not liable for the 
adequacy, accuracy, or completeness 
of such information. Data relied upon in 
this report may be produced based on 
methodologies that are not transparent 
to Howden, and the data used and 
underlying methodologies are subject to 
change without notice.
This report and the data contained herein 
has not been externally assured, verified
