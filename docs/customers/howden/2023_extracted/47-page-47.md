Energy-efficiency action 
During the reporting period, we have completed the following energy efficiency  
actions at various sites in the UK. 
•	 Installed solar film on windows and made  
repairs or adjustments to window seals  
to avoid draughts or heat loss
•	 Replaced air-conditioning units with more  
efficient systems
•	 Adjusted temperature set points in comms  
rooms, raising from 19 to 22 degrees to  
reduce energy consumption
•	 Re-set air-conditioning time clocks to 
better align with office opening times, 
reducing wasted energy out-of-hours
•	 Continued with replacement of existing  
lighting with energy-efficient LEDs
•	 In 2024, we plan to invest in installing 
building-level energy AMR metering for 
a limited number of sites as a pilot, to 
improve accuracy of reporting and provide 
real-time consumption data to identify 
areas of wastage.
