Throughout 2023, colleagues at Howden India 
showcased their commitment to giving back by  
focusing their efforts on bolstering education  
and skill development for underprivileged students  
and youth in India.
A standout effort involved sponsoring a 45-day skill 
development workshop aimed at preparing marginalised 
youth for grey-collar jobs like engineers, healthcare 
workers, and IT specialists. This initiative directly 
addressed unemployment challenges, empowering over 
1,000 young people with crucial employable skills.
Additionally, Howden India collaborated with Round 
Table India to contribute to essential infrastructure  
for schools. Their support in constructing school  
toilets directly benefited approximately 400 students. 
They also helped to build five new classrooms across 
two local administration-run schools, aiming to alleviate 
overcrowding issues and create a conducive learning 
environment for hundreds of students. 
In alignment with their commitment to digital 
empowerment, Howden India partnered with Udaan to 
distribute 40 laptops to high-performing students from 
low-income families. This endeavour focused  
on bridging the digital divide, enabling equitable  
access to technology for those most in need.
By investing in education and skill development, Howden 
India is making significant strides towards breaking 
the cycle of poverty, promoting social inclusion, and 
fostering sustainable economic growth in the region.
