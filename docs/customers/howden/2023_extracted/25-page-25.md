Launched in October 2022,  
the All of Us campaign is a two-
year, global employee initiative 
to harness our collective power 
through thousands of individual 
pledges to take an action or 
start a project to contribute to 
building a business we can all be 
proud of; open to all, diverse, 
inclusive and nurturing, creating 
a community in which everyone 
feels they belong.
The campaign both empowers people across the Group 
to drive the change they want to see, and helps to inform 
and accelerate leaders’ D&I plans. 
At the time of writing this report, over 1,700 employees 
from 38 countries have made pledges to act.
