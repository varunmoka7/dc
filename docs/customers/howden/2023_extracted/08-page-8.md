Carbon markets 
Investing in carbon markets is often perceived  
to be a complex and challenging path to navigate.  
It combines project financing, long term investments, 
emerging markets, as well as societal and  
environmental considerations.
Insurance can help alleviate this uncertainty across 
the carbon credit lifecycle by transferring certain risks 
to a qualified third party. This makes carbon markets 
more accessible to a wider range of investors, in turn, 
significantly increasing the overall size of the market.  
Following the launch of the world-first voluntary  
carbon credit insurance product, we continue to  
design solutions across the carbon value chain  
to securitise and professionalise the market.

 Howden Group Holdings 2023 Sustainability Report 
Changing the insurance narrative
$150trn
estimated investment between now and 2050  
to transition the global economy and avoid the  
worst physical impacts of climate change.
Enabling the energy transition     
Systemically transforming the world’s energy system  
by 2050 “may well prove to be the largest greatest 
reallocation of capital in history.”* (source: McKinsey)  
By one estimate, that’s $150trn of investment between 
now and 2050 to transition the global economy and 
avoid the worst physical impacts of climate change.  
Insurance has a long history of facilitating investment 
and has a pivotal role to play in unlocking the finance 
needed to enable the transition. Projects that support 
the transition to clean energy are largely untested, 
expensive, and risky, which means that there are often 
significant barriers to financing them.  
Insurance can de-risk project financing models and 
improve the bankability of projects, as well as lower 
the cost of capital. It can help scale new, and first-of-a-
kind, technology, and it can be used to hedge revenue 
shortfalls associated with specific weather conditions. 
Across Howden, our teams continue to work with  
clients and the wider insurance market to de-risk  
and incentivise investment in the energy transition.
