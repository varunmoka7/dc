Humanitarian  
appeals
Over the past year, our global team rallied behind three 
significant humanitarian causes: the earthquakes in 
Turkey and Syria, the earthquake in Morocco, and 
the floods in Libya. Our people demonstrated their 
generosity, collectively contributing over £40,000  
to support these critical appeals.
The Howden Foundation further magnified this by 
matching employee donations, generously providing 
£15,500 in matched funding, with an additional direct 
donation of £33,500 to the Turkey appeal. 
This resulted in a substantial total contribution of  
£93,500, providing crucial aid to those affected by  
these urgent crises.
Building on this impactful initiative, we have introduced 
dedicated humanitarian appeal pages on our Group 
Giving platform for the Red Cross and the International 
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 
(IFRC). 
These pages serve as efficient channels, allowing our 
colleagues to contribute swiftly and effectively when 
confronted with future environmental or humanitarian 
crises. Through these ongoing efforts, we aim to 
continue fostering a culture of support and rapid 
response within our global community.
