As we seek to address the global climate crisis we 
are finding ways to de-risk the climate transition and 
build resilience. To meet the scale of investment and 
breadth of solutions needed, we partner with key actors 
including governments, public and private sector, the 
insurance and financial markets, as well as those on the 
climate frontline.  
In 2023, we appointed Rowan Douglas as CEO, Howden 
Climate Risk & Resilience, to continue to build an expert, 
full spectrum function to support our businesses  
worldwide, embedding our climate risk and resilience 
offering across the group’s specialities and regions.  
At the heart of Howden, our multidisciplinary team  
of 60 now combines a unique depth and breadth 
of climate science expertise, experience in private 
and public sector, as well as academia, and a deep 
experience of the inner workings of the insurance  
and financial markets.  
Complementing an existing climate risk research and 
product development hub, we now offer a strategic 
advisory service to accelerate and de-risk the move 
towards a low-carbon economy, and to mitigate the 
results of climate change. 
Our Climate Risk & Resilience team is on a mission 
to lead the way in de-risking the climate challenge 
by mobilising investment and protecting assets, 
businesses and livelihoods.
