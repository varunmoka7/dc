Our Board drives our 
strategic objectives as a 
business. The roles of the 
Chairman and CEO are 
separate to encourage 
a strong and healthy 
decision-making process.  
The Board comprises the Chairman, CEO, CFO and  
10 non-executive directors. They bring diverse skills  
and views to the Board thanks to their experience on 
various external advisory and insurance-sector boards 
including changing regulatory and business landscapes,  
sustainability, and diversity and inclusion.
Sustainability governance   
Sustainability is on the agenda at both Board and  
Group Executive Committee meetings. With Board 
members chairing the ESG & Sustainability  
Committee and the Diversity and Inclusion Committee, 
there is direct communication between the decision 
makers and the committees.
As well as being chaired by a Non-Executive Director 
of the Board, the ESG & Sustainability Committee also 
comprises of members of our senior management. 
We continue to review our committees, structure and 
members to ensure they are fit for purpose in this 
changing climate.
We have clear policies and systems in place to ensure 
high standards across fundamental issues like data 
protection, financial crime, cyber security, human rights, 
and supporting employee wellbeing.
