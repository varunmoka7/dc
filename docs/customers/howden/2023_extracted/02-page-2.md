Howden in numbers:
Our story began in 1994 with 
three people and a dog. Now 
there are 17,000 of us, and we’re 
a leading global insurance group, 
managing $38bn of premiums  
for our clients.
From our first day, Howden had five key  
things that we still hold dear today:
From the beginning, the driving motivation was to 
build a great company that’s owned by the people 
who work for it.  This employee ownership model is 
what sets us apart. It’s the bedrock of our culture, 
and the reason we’ve grown year-on-year since 
landing our first client back in 1994.
