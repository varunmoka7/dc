First-of-its-kind carbon 
capture and storage  
insurance facility 
Carbon capture and storage (CSS) technology allows  
for the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere and storing 
it. We believe that this technology is central to helping to 
achieve net zero emissions and that insurance solutions 
can help protect the financial viability and stability of 
CCS projects. One of the key risks associated with CCS 
technology is leakage into the air, land or water, which 
could lead to environmental damage or loss of revenue.  
Designed by Howden and led by SCOR’s syndicate at 
Lloyd’s, we have created a first-of-its-kind insurance 
facility covering CO2 leakage from commercial-scale 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities.

Case study
This breakthrough shows how insurance helps 
unlock vital finance to drive the net zero transition 
at the scope and speed required. By improving 
the bankability of critical CCS projects, we are 
establishing insurance as a force for good and 
building on the work being done by the Sustainable 
Markets Initiative (SMI)* to realise the potential of 
engineered carbon removal solutions and move this 
nascent sector into the mainstream.
