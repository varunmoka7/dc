 Howden Group Holdings 2023 Sustainability Report 
Sustainability is at the heart of our business. We cannot 
deliver long-term value for our people and our clients 
without taking into account the wider picture of the 
global imperative to create a cleaner, fairer, safer, more 
resilient world.
Our clients span most industries and geographies and 
so too does our ability to effect positive change. We 
believe insurance is more than just a financial product; 
it can be a force for good by enabling people to invest 
in better futures, the environment, the economy and the 
world at large. 
We are committed to putting sustainability at the heart 
of our strategy through the people we hire, the work we 
do, and our own impact as a company and we work to  
do this through three pillars.
