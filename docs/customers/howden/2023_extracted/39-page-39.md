Group Giving platform     
Our Group Giving platform (powered by Benevity) 
efficiently streamlines our global volunteering and 
fundraising activity. This centralised hub offers a wide 
variety of opportunities, and inspires and assists our 
people in their giving endeavours. 
The platform is available to all colleagues and serves as 
a catalyst for engagement, empowering them to make a 
difference for the causes close to their hearts.
The platform not only showcases the impact of their 
efforts and the difference they are making to other 
peopleâ€™s lives, but also identifies the most supported 
causes, enabling us to design the most impactful 
programmes for our people. 
Having a single source of information for colleagues 
that offers global volunteering opportunities, as well 
as global causes to support through fundraising and 
donations, has proved hugely successful in supporting 
our teams, and those in need, worldwide.
As a growing group, we continue to get more and more 
colleagues engaged with the platform through activation 
calls, demos, and internal campaigns.
