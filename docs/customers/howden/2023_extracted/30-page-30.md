Gender pay gap 
The report details the gender pay gap  data taken on 5 April 2023  
from across our UK businesses under our Howden Group Services 
employing entity. 
Since the snapshot data of the 2022 report, we have made several 
acquisitions, including Aston Lark, A-Plan and KGM. This  means the 
population we are reporting on has grown from 2,485  employees to  
5,779 employees and accordingly the data reflects a significantly  
different workforce.

The data shows a reduction in both our median hourly gender pay gap and 
median bonus pay gap compared to April 2022, reflecting the increase 
of women now represented in the upper quartile (from 17.3% in 2022 to 
27.5% for the year) and the upper mid quartile (from 32.6% in 2022 to 
48.0% in 2023). We have seen a slight increase in the mean hourly gender 
pay gap (from 42.48% in 2022 to 45.10% for the year) as women remain 
underrepresented in the upper quartile. We have seen an overall reduction  
in the percentage of colleagues receiving a bonus at the 2023 snapshot.  
This is because acquisitions where a smaller proportion of employees that 
are eligible to receive a bonus came into scope for this yearâ€™s analysis.
We recognise that the gender pay gap is a complex issue influenced  
by various factors such as access to opportunities, career progression,  
and representation in senior leadership roles.
As such, we continue to implement targeted initiatives to address  
these challenges and promote gender equality across Howden.  
Further information on these initiatives can be found in our  
2023 Gender Pay Gap Report.
