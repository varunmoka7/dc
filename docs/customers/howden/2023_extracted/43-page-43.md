DUAL ANZ 
In 2023 DUAL Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) 
supported charities through a number of fundraising  
and volunteering activities. 
DUAL ANZ significantly contributed to mental health 
advocacy through their partnership with Black Dog 
Institute, an Australian mental health charity. Led by  
CEO Damien Coates, the team conducted 19 mental 
health presentations, reaching 3,800 individuals and 
raising A$88,000.
They raised over A$440,000 for 286 charities, with 
A$283,000 directed to the Black Dog Institute. Events 
ranged from challenging hikes to engaging comedy 
nights and drag bingo events across multiple cities,  
all promoting mental health awareness.
They raised over A$45,000 for causes like Movember, 
cancer research, disabilities, and literacy charities.  
The team dedicated more than 700 hours to physical 
challenges to help raise this amount.
The teams across ANZ devoted over 1,400 hours to 
volunteering for various causes.
