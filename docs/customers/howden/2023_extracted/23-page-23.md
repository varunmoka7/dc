Being a responsible business
 Howden Group Holdings 2023 Sustainability Report 
Our people and culture
Putting our people  
first has been part  
of our fabric since 
Howden was founded 
back in 1994.
We have always been employee-owned and driven  
by entrepreneurial spirit. Right from the beginning,  
we’ve focused on employing talented individuals  
and empowering them to make a real difference to  
the company, whilst building successful and fulfilling 
careers at the same time. 
Our business succeeds by allowing our people to  
make a mark in the areas they care about most: 
personal development, volunteering and fundraising 
for charity, or creating new insurance products that 
address society’s greatest challenges.
