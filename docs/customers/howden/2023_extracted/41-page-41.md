 Howden Group Holdings 2023 Sustainability Report 
Global Group  
Giving Month     
Following the success of our previous year’s Global 
Group Giving Week campaign, we decided to go bigger 
and hold a Global Group Giving Month (GGGM) over 
the whole month of May to create more opportunities 
to make a positive difference to the communities and 
charities in which we live and work. 
The theme for GGGM in 2023 was ‘Year of the Team’, 
and teams around the world came together to volunteer, 
fundraise, and host sporting challenges and events  
– all focussed around giving back.
For this year’s ‘Global Group Giving Month’, we donated 
blood, cleaned beaches, helped out at animal shelters, 
planted mangroves and distributed food. We ran, cycled, 
rowed, danced and walked and raised awareness of 
important causes.
Together, we raised over £144,000, volunteered  
over 4,250 hours and supported over 110  
charities worldwide.
