As well as being there to pick up the pieces when things go wrong,  
insurance has the power to give people the confidence to invest  
in the future.
Whether that’s for those investing the trillions of dollars 
needed to drive the net zero transition, or a smallholder 
farmer in Rwanda having the confidence to sow all of 
their seed without fear of extreme weather wiping out 
their crops.
Insurance – a force for good
To unlock this potential, in 2023, we continued to grow 
our climate risk and resilience capabilities. Our now 
60-strong global team of experts in climate science,  
law, insurance, and humanitarian solutions is putting  
de-risking at the heart of the climate conversation. 
Through our work with Cambridge Institute of 
Sustainability Leadership this year, we demonstrated 
how insurance can help make entire nations more 
investable by using insurance to protect their GDP 
against losses above a pre-agreed level. 
Our employee-ownership structure and empowered 
business model allow us to adapt quickly to meet 
changing needs in an ever-more volatile world. We’ve 
proven year after year that putting our people first and 
creating the conditions for everyone to thrive results in 
better outcomes for all of our stakeholders.
A great place for All of Us 
Now in its second year, our global employee initiative, 
All of Us, is getting colleagues across the Group actively 
thinking about how they can contribute towards making 
this a great place to work for people from all walks of life 
– and, crucially, pledging to take action. 
At the time of writing, we had over 1,700 employees 
across 37 countries all having pledged to act from our 
100+ branches across the UK all pledging to partner  
with a local school, to the international roll out of 
diversity roundtables and reciprocal mentoring 
programmes, to pledges and initiatives that help 
employees to balance family commitments with work 
life. This powerful campaign is both empowering our 
people to drive the change they want to see and is 
helping to inform and accelerate our businesses’  
wider diversity and inclusion plans and activities. 
Also playing a central role in making this a business we 
all want to work for are  our Employee Resource Groups 
who continue to be a driving force behind important 
changes such as introducing a new menopause benefit 
in the UK. 
Giving back 
Every year, I’m proud to see the collective power of our 
people in giving back. Supported by matched funding 
from the Howden Foundation, in 2023, our colleagues 
and businesses around the world donated over £1.1m  
to causes and communities close to their heart. 
As well as supporting our employees’ fundraising efforts, 
the Howden Foundation, which, since its inception 
has donated over £5.6m to charities around the world, 
continued to advance its mission to protect people 
against the social and economic shocks of climate 
change through existing and new partnerships, including 
the Start Network, who are providing early access to 
disaster risk financing for frontline humanitarian groups.
Our impact on the environment
Building on the significant work that has gone into 
establishing our baseline carbon emissions, we are 
now in a position to focus our efforts into targeted 
carbon reduction plans in pursuit of net zero. This year 
we implemented Salesforce’s Net Zero Cloud and are 
now well-positioned and committed to making tangible 
strides towards meeting our ambitions. 
A fairer, more resilient future for all 
2023 felt like a turning point in terms of recognising 
the role our industry has to play in building a more 
sustainable future. At COP28, insurance and de-risking 
– topics that had historically lived in the fringes had 
become firmly embedded in the narrative. 
It’s hugely encouraging that others can see the value 
that we know insurance can bring – it is now incumbent 
upon us to continue to channel our collective efforts as 
a company, and industry, to drive, with urgency and at 
scale, the use of this powerful tool to drive the change 
needed to create a fairer, more resilient future for all. 
I have been heartened by some of the steps taken by parts of the 
insurance sector, which plays such a vital role in incentivizing  
more sustainable approaches and providing an invaluable source  
of investment to reduce the risks we face.
