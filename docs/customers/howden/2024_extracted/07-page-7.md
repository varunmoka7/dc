Our approach to sustainability 
A long-term approach to sustainability 
We are focused on creating 
a fairer, more resilient 
world in order to create 
long-term value for our 
people, communities, 
clients, and shareholders. 
01
De-risking the 
energy transition
As industry leaders, we are expanding the 
value proposition of insurance. We believe 
that insurance is critical to the fabric of 
society and economies, helping to address 
the major challenges of our time and drive 
positive change.
Our focus areas
•	 Enabling the transition to net zero
•	 Supporting urban resilience planning
•	 Unlocking investment in nature-based solutions 
•	 Data and technology-led innovation

experts bring a 
distinctive blend of 
experience, insight, and 
insurance knowledge.

02
Empowering people  
and communities
What we do to have a positive social impact is 
focused on empowering people. Empowering 
people on the climate frontline to build 
resilience and empowering our people to 
put giving back at the heart of everything 
we do and to create an inclusive working 
environment where everyone feels proud 
to work. 
Our focus areas
•	 Making Howden a great place to work for people 
from all walks of life
•	 Empowering people on the climate frontline to 
build resilience
•	 Community impact

business risks; and operate with integrity – 
all of which are critical to our success.

Insurance can be a powerful catalyst for positive 
change, enabling better investment in technologies, 
people, and assets that support society and the planet. 
Our focus on sustainability is guided by three 
foundational pillars: de-risking the climate transition, 
empowering people and communities, and being a 
responsible business.
