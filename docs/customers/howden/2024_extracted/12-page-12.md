The Bigger Picture  
a Howden report
According to the research, $19 trillion 
in investment capital has already been 
committed by energy companies, 
governments, and private equity to 
finance the climate transition through to 
2030*, a figure that is equivalent to the 
combined annual GDP of the twenty-
seven nations of the European Union.
However, too few projects meet the risk 
thresholds required by investors. To 
unlock this enormous sum, the insurance 
industry will need to provide more 
than $10 trillion in additional coverage, 
including for innovative insurance 
solutions that will help make climate 
projects investable. It is only by de-risking 
investments in climate technologies and 
nature-based solutions that businesses, 
governments, and investors will be able 
to drive the transition forward.

Our joint report with Boston Consulting 
Group was a wake-up call to markets 
and clients, which galvanised broader 
climate finance leaders from banking 
and investment to position insurance 
in strategic planning to address climate 
transition challenges.

Managing risk is one of the biggest barriers to a just 
and resilient transition. Insurance can provide the 
certainty, clarity and security to achieve the radical 
transformation needed and will be instrumental 
across sectors and industries globally to shape 
a net zero, fair future for all.”
