Message from our CEO
We worked closely with clients to 
address the challenges – and seize the 
opportunities – of a more sustainable 
future. Our research with Boston 
Consulting Group highlighted the 
additional $10 trillion of insurance 
coverage needed to unlock the climate 
transition. In June, we brought together 
public and private sector leaders to 
discuss how to bridge that gap at the 
first ever De-risking Summit. And we 
continued driving this agenda throughout 
the year not least at November’s COP29.
Our actions in 2024 included:
•	 launching innovative new insurance 
products to de-risk investment in 
the technologies needed for a net-
zero future – such as a first-of-its-
kind insurance facility to cover the 
environmental damage and loss arising 
from the leakage of CO2 from Carbon 
Capture and Storage projects
•	 growing our data and insight 
capabilities to help clients better 
understand their climate risks and 
increase their resilience – including 
working with Microsoft to establish the 
Howden Resilience Laboratory  
•	 collaborating with city leaders across 
three continents to build urban 
resilience – from reducing the risk of 
wildfires for homeowners in California 
and quantifying the hidden cost of 
flooding in Cape Town to increasing 
water resilience in Lagos – in the 
second year of the Global Risk and 
Resilience Fellowship
2024 saw us step up on the humanitarian 
front too. We brought together the 
insurance industry to launch Humanity 
Insured (HI)  – a global not-for-profit that 
is helping make insurance accessible and 
effective for people living on the climate 
crisis frontline.
In just three months, HI mobilised more 
than £42 milllion of insurance capacity to 
support a million people from West Africa 
to Papua New Guinea. And, at the time 
of writing, the charity is already having 
an impact with a number of significant 
claims paid out.
In its 10th year, our corporate foundation, 
the Howden Foundation, grew its portfolio 
of long-term partnerships in pursuit of 
its vision of a world where everyone is 
resilient to the impacts of climate change. 
All the while, the Foundation continued 
to drive employee giving with a bumper 
year of matched funding and donations 
through its employee-nominated annual 
charity awards.
In fact, 2024 saw colleagues volunteer 
nearly 15,000 hours and raise almost 
£900,000 for more than 1,000 charities 
across 32 countries. In the UK, our 
people selected Maggie’s cancer 
care as the new charity partner – raising 
more than £400,000 in the first year of 
the two-year partnership.
Once again, the teams in DUAL Australia 
and New Zealand led the global giving 
charge. And they celebrated their 
20th year in the best way possible – 
by raising even more and smashing 
through two major milestones with their 
long-term mental health charity partner, 
Black Dog Institute.
Meanwhile, we continued embedding 
sustainability at the core of our operations 
– setting a 2040 net zero target, evolving 
our carbon offset portfolio, and improving 
energy-efficiency and waste management 
measures across our offices and branches.
2024 was the year we celebrated our 
30th anniversary. We’ve grown as a 
company from three people and a dog 
to more than 22,000 in 56 countries. Yet 
we remain a business that continues to 
place employee ownership at the heart of 
what we do - with employees our largest 
single shareholder group. And what could 
be more sustainable than those who own 
the business doing the business! But 
2024 was also a year in which we vowed 
to keep upping our game. The challenges 
humanity faces aren’t going away any 
time soon. So, while 2024 was a year of 
action and impact, our challenge is to 
think ahead to the next 30 years and keep 
raising the bar.

we accelerated our efforts to help create 
a fairer, more resilient world.
