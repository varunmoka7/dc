Strategic leadership 
and decision making
Our approach to governance is founded 
upon a culture of transparency and 
empowerment. Whilst the board provides 
strategic direction, it does not intrude 
or interfere in the day-to-day operations 
of the group and its trading companies. 
Instead, the Group Leadership Team 
(GLT) and the Business Management 
Team (BMT) drive cultural and operational 
decision-making and maintain oversight 
through strong governance structures.
The GLT fosters collaboration across 
businesses to promote transparency and 
alignment, while the BMT supports the 
operational and strategic direction of the 
group. This approach reinforces our flat 
hierarchy and empowers business leaders 
to deliver on their objectives whilst allowing 
alignment with our governance framework.
Board and committees
The board includes the Chairman, CEO, 
CFO, COO and a team of non-executive 
directors with a range of experience 
across industries and regulatory 
landscapes. Chaired by independent 
non-executive directors, various board 
committees support the board.
•	 The Risk committee: provides 
leadership, direction and oversight 
of the group’s overall risk appetite, 
tolerance and strategy, overseeing and 
advising the board on the current and 
potential future risk exposures of the 
group, reviewing and approving the 
group’s risk management framework, 
and monitoring its effectiveness and 
adherence to the various risk policies. 
Our Group ESG & Sustainability 
Committee and Diversity & Inclusion

directors of the board and comprise of 
senior leadership and internal subject 
matter experts: 
•	 ESG & Sustainability Committee: 
plays a crucial role in supporting the 
board by providing strategic direction 
on sustainability and ESG matters 
concerning employees, suppliers, 
investors, and society. The purpose of 
the committee is to lead the Group’s 
environment and sustainability 
strategy, oversee environment 
and sustainability reporting, and 
offer guidance on related policies 
and procedures. Furthermore, the 
committee reviews environmental 
and sustainability data and metrics, 
liaises with the Group Risk and Audit 
Committees on relevant metrics, and 
reviews regulatory and compliance 
matters concerning environment 
and sustainability topics. This 
comprehensive oversight ensures the 
effective implementation of sustainable 
practices across the Group.
•	 Diversity & Inclusion Committee:

opportunities for all, and to nurture 
an inclusive working environment.
