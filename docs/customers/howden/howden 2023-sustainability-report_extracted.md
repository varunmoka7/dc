Howden in numbers:
Our story began in 1994 with 
three people and a dog. Now 
there are 17,000 of us, and we’re 
a leading global insurance group, 
managing $38bn of premiums  
for our clients.
From our first day, Howden had five key  
things that we still hold dear today:
From the beginning, the driving motivation was to 
build a great company that’s owned by the people 
who work for it.  This employee ownership model is 
what sets us apart. It’s the bedrock of our culture, 
and the reason we’ve grown year-on-year since 
landing our first client back in 1994.

As well as being there to pick up the pieces when things go wrong,  
insurance has the power to give people the confidence to invest  
in the future.
Whether that’s for those investing the trillions of dollars 
needed to drive the net zero transition, or a smallholder 
farmer in Rwanda having the confidence to sow all of 
their seed without fear of extreme weather wiping out 
their crops.
Insurance – a force for good
To unlock this potential, in 2023, we continued to grow 
our climate risk and resilience capabilities. Our now 
60-strong global team of experts in climate science,  
law, insurance, and humanitarian solutions is putting  
de-risking at the heart of the climate conversation. 
Through our work with Cambridge Institute of 
Sustainability Leadership this year, we demonstrated 
how insurance can help make entire nations more 
investable by using insurance to protect their GDP 
against losses above a pre-agreed level. 
Our employee-ownership structure and empowered 
business model allow us to adapt quickly to meet 
changing needs in an ever-more volatile world. We’ve 
proven year after year that putting our people first and 
creating the conditions for everyone to thrive results in 
better outcomes for all of our stakeholders.
A great place for All of Us 
Now in its second year, our global employee initiative, 
All of Us, is getting colleagues across the Group actively 
thinking about how they can contribute towards making 
this a great place to work for people from all walks of life 
– and, crucially, pledging to take action. 
At the time of writing, we had over 1,700 employees 
across 37 countries all having pledged to act from our 
100+ branches across the UK all pledging to partner  
with a local school, to the international roll out of 
diversity roundtables and reciprocal mentoring 
programmes, to pledges and initiatives that help 
employees to balance family commitments with work 
life. This powerful campaign is both empowering our 
people to drive the change they want to see and is 
helping to inform and accelerate our businesses’  
wider diversity and inclusion plans and activities. 
Also playing a central role in making this a business we 
all want to work for are  our Employee Resource Groups 
who continue to be a driving force behind important 
changes such as introducing a new menopause benefit 
in the UK. 
Giving back 
Every year, I’m proud to see the collective power of our 
people in giving back. Supported by matched funding 
from the Howden Foundation, in 2023, our colleagues 
and businesses around the world donated over £1.1m  
to causes and communities close to their heart. 
As well as supporting our employees’ fundraising efforts, 
the Howden Foundation, which, since its inception 
has donated over £5.6m to charities around the world, 
continued to advance its mission to protect people 
against the social and economic shocks of climate 
change through existing and new partnerships, including 
the Start Network, who are providing early access to 
disaster risk financing for frontline humanitarian groups.
Our impact on the environment
Building on the significant work that has gone into 
establishing our baseline carbon emissions, we are 
now in a position to focus our efforts into targeted 
carbon reduction plans in pursuit of net zero. This year 
we implemented Salesforce’s Net Zero Cloud and are 
now well-positioned and committed to making tangible 
strides towards meeting our ambitions. 
A fairer, more resilient future for all 
2023 felt like a turning point in terms of recognising 
the role our industry has to play in building a more 
sustainable future. At COP28, insurance and de-risking 
– topics that had historically lived in the fringes had 
become firmly embedded in the narrative. 
It’s hugely encouraging that others can see the value 
that we know insurance can bring – it is now incumbent 
upon us to continue to channel our collective efforts as 
a company, and industry, to drive, with urgency and at 
scale, the use of this powerful tool to drive the change 
needed to create a fairer, more resilient future for all. 
I have been heartened by some of the steps taken by parts of the 
insurance sector, which plays such a vital role in incentivizing  
more sustainable approaches and providing an invaluable source  
of investment to reduce the risks we face.

As we seek to address the global climate crisis we 
are finding ways to de-risk the climate transition and 
build resilience. To meet the scale of investment and 
breadth of solutions needed, we partner with key actors 
including governments, public and private sector, the 
insurance and financial markets, as well as those on the 
climate frontline.  
In 2023, we appointed Rowan Douglas as CEO, Howden 
Climate Risk & Resilience, to continue to build an expert, 
full spectrum function to support our businesses  
worldwide, embedding our climate risk and resilience 
offering across the group’s specialities and regions.  
At the heart of Howden, our multidisciplinary team  
of 60 now combines a unique depth and breadth 
of climate science expertise, experience in private 
and public sector, as well as academia, and a deep 
experience of the inner workings of the insurance  
and financial markets.  
Complementing an existing climate risk research and 
product development hub, we now offer a strategic 
advisory service to accelerate and de-risk the move 
towards a low-carbon economy, and to mitigate the 
results of climate change. 
Our Climate Risk & Resilience team is on a mission 
to lead the way in de-risking the climate challenge 
by mobilising investment and protecting assets, 
businesses and livelihoods.

Carbon markets 
Investing in carbon markets is often perceived  
to be a complex and challenging path to navigate.  
It combines project financing, long term investments, 
emerging markets, as well as societal and  
environmental considerations.
Insurance can help alleviate this uncertainty across 
the carbon credit lifecycle by transferring certain risks 
to a qualified third party. This makes carbon markets 
more accessible to a wider range of investors, in turn, 
significantly increasing the overall size of the market.  
Following the launch of the world-first voluntary  
carbon credit insurance product, we continue to  
design solutions across the carbon value chain  
to securitise and professionalise the market.

$150trn
estimated investment between now and 2050  
to transition the global economy and avoid the  
worst physical impacts of climate change.
Enabling the energy transition     
Systemically transforming the world’s energy system  
by 2050 “may well prove to be the largest greatest 
reallocation of capital in history.”* (source: McKinsey)  
By one estimate, that’s $150trn of investment between 
now and 2050 to transition the global economy and 
avoid the worst physical impacts of climate change.  
Insurance has a long history of facilitating investment 
and has a pivotal role to play in unlocking the finance 
needed to enable the transition. Projects that support 
the transition to clean energy are largely untested, 
expensive, and risky, which means that there are often 
significant barriers to financing them.  
Insurance can de-risk project financing models and 
improve the bankability of projects, as well as lower 
the cost of capital. It can help scale new, and first-of-a-
kind, technology, and it can be used to hedge revenue 
shortfalls associated with specific weather conditions. 
Across Howden, our teams continue to work with  
clients and the wider insurance market to de-risk  
and incentivise investment in the energy transition.

First-of-its-kind carbon 
capture and storage  
insurance facility 
Carbon capture and storage (CSS) technology allows  
for the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere and storing 
it. We believe that this technology is central to helping to 
achieve net zero emissions and that insurance solutions 
can help protect the financial viability and stability of 
CCS projects. One of the key risks associated with CCS 
technology is leakage into the air, land or water, which 
could lead to environmental damage or loss of revenue.  
Designed by Howden and led by SCOR’s syndicate at 
Lloyd’s, we have created a first-of-its-kind insurance 
facility covering CO2 leakage from commercial-scale 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities. 
View the press release
Case study
This breakthrough shows how insurance helps 
unlock vital finance to drive the net zero transition 
at the scope and speed required. By improving 
the bankability of critical CCS projects, we are 
establishing insurance as a force for good and 
building on the work being done by the Sustainable 
Markets Initiative (SMI)* to realise the potential of 
engineered carbon removal solutions and move this 
nascent sector into the mainstream.

The total population of world cities is projected to  
grow from 4.2 billion in 2018, to 8.7 billion by 2050.*  
This migration drives an urgent need to build resilience 
and focus on adaptation planning in the fight against 
climate change.  
In partnership with Resilient Cities Network, we launched 
the Global Risk and Resilience Fellowship in 2022. 
Focused on embedding insurance expertise at the heart 
of city resilience, it brings together city leaders with a 
deep understanding of urban resilience challenges and 
those with the expertise and resources to overcome 
those challenges. The objective being to collaboratively 
develop solutions that empower cities to build a safe, 
equitable, and sustainable future for all. 
In 2023, five insurance professionals (“Fellows”) were 
placed into city leadership teams to work on specific 
resilience challenges. The cities selected were Glasgow, 
UK; Greater Miami & the Beaches, USA; Melaka, Malaysia; 
Cities are the engines for implementing the 
sustainable development goals, which provide  
a blueprint for achieving global sustainability.*
Supporting urban 
resilience planning:  
The Hague, Netherlands; and Surat, India. Over the 
course of each three-to-six-month placement, Fellows 
and city leaders worked together to consider how to 
use insurance sector expertise and the power of risk 
transfer to bridge the resilience gaps identified by city 
leaders and support long-term sustainable growth. 
The fellowship successfully contributed to building 
resilience in every city. These shocks and stresses 
however, affect each city differently; therefore, 
addressing each city’s challenge required tailored 
advice from the Fellows and led to unique outcomes  
in each city. 
These outcomes, and the work conducted in each city  
are discussed in detail in this report.

Insurance Development  
Forum 
We continue to work with the Insurance Development 
Forum (IDF) as a member of the Sovereign and 
Humanitarian Solutions (SHS) working group. 
The overarching objective of the SHS working group 
is to address the insurance needs of sovereigns, sub- 
sovereigns, international institutions, and humanitarian 
agencies in programmes and territories that are usually 
supported by donors or developments banks. 
The IDF is a public/private partnership led by the 
insurance industry and supported by international 
organisations. 
The IDF was first announced at the United Nations 
Conference of the Parties (COP21) Paris Climate  
summit in 2015 and draws on a broad membership, 
from insurers, reinsurers and insurance brokers to 
regulators and international institutions such as  
the World Bank.

Helping vulnerable 
communities 
financially prepare  
for the future  
We are committed to finding scalable ways to empower 
communities disproportionately affected by climate 
change to be better financially prepared for disasters. 
Experience shows that building resilience in these 
communities is one of the surest ways to limit the 
devastating impacts of climate-induced disasters and 
support recovery.  
In pursuit of this goal, over the past two years, Howden 
has provided over US$600,000 to support innovative 
pilot projects that make insurance and risk modelling 
expertise available to those who need it most. 
This includes, but is not limited to, projects responding 
to extreme weather events in India, Belize, the 
Philippines, Jamaica, Rwanda and Fiji. 
In Fiji, we partnered with the UNCDF to protect those 
most vulnerable to damage from tropical cyclones and 
floods. This resulted in payments being transferred 
directly into the mobile wallets of 536 beneficiaries 
within 10 days of the event. 
We are in the process of establishing an independent 
charitable trust to scale this model. Its goal is to mobilise 
$2bn of insurance limit annually in partnership with 
those on the ground responding to disasters driven  
by climate change.

In 2023 we created Howden Climate Parametrics,  
a global practice that brings together (re)insurance, 
climate, and data expertise to focus parametric risk 
transfer solutions on meeting the escalating demand 
for de-risking capabilities across industries, financial 
markets and public sector. 
The practice focuses on harnessing key partnerships, 
data, analytics and modelling resource to create 
parametric products that build resilience to multiple 
hazards and support decarbonisation. 
The practice builds on solutions that we have delivered 
in partnership to date, such as for smallholder farmers  
in Jamaica and those living near 10 active volcanoes,  
as well as two marine protected areas in the Philippines 
and Belize. 
What is Parametric insurance?
Where traditional indemnity insurance pays out based 
on a measured loss, a parametric payout corresponds  
to the magnitude of an event.  
This means no protracted claims process, which  
makes the payouts quick and transparent and is 
essential for financial institutions looking to hedge 
exposure to weather, carbon or commodity risks  
and for humanitarian agencies seeking non-political, 
urgent resources after a disaster.  
Critically, these payouts can also be triggered before  
an event. Using advanced technology and analytics, it is 
possible to predict extreme climate events, enabling us 
to structure insurance that reliably releases funds upon 
a certain data point being recorded. 
This means that in the case of low rainfall, for example, 
funds can be released before the drought hits, allowing 
communities to prepare and divert a disaster from 
becoming a crisis. 
Pioneered in the reinsurance and energy markets, 
parametric insurance offers pre-determined 
payouts based on specified trigger events.

Cycle of under-investment: Lack of cover blocks 
access to productivity-enhancing inputs and 
technologies in subsequent growing sessions
Case study 1: No cover
Building preparedness  
on the climate frontline 
There are over 608 million smallholder farmers 
worldwide, who provide 80% of domestic food 
production in Africa and Asia, and 35% of the world’s 
food. They face increasing frequency and severity of 
climate shocks,  but often lack access to the tools 
required to mitigate them. 
Insurance gives these farmers certainty and the 
confidence to invest in their futures, which can increase 
productivity by 16%* and has a wider positive impact  
on poverty alleviation, health, education and mitigation  
of excess rural out-migration, even in circumstances  
where claims are not triggered. 
This is because smallholders with access to the safety 
net provided by insurance are empowered to invest  
and help break entrenched poverty cycles. 
We are on a mission to help expand parametric 
protection through premium support to cover hundreds 
of millions of smallholder farmers. In 2023 we partnered 
with Global Parametrics (GP) and One Acre Fund (1AF) 
to support their scheme that previously reached almost 
175,000 smallholder farmers in Tanzania and Malawi. 
We provided premium subsidy to help expand the  
scheme, allowing 1AF to purchase more coverage  
for smallholder farmers vulnerable to extreme weather 
risks in a landlocked country where agriculture is  
a mainstay of the economy. The scheme is now  
targeting protection for 800,000 people in Rwanda. 
One Acre Fund (1AF) is a nonprofit servicing low  
income farmers (oneacrefund.org). 
As the following diagram shows, the cumulative impact 
of these benefits can be to spur a virtuous cycle of 
reinvestment at the farm level – in contrast to the  
vicious cycle of under-investment that threatens 
smallholders who lack adequate mechanisms to  
manage external shocks.

This innovative initiative has the potential to 
protect vulnerable countries from climate-
related losses with pre-arranged financing 
at a large scale, unlocking the risk capital 
markets to multiply the impact of donor 
funds. Mobilising private finance alongside 
the new loss and damage fund  
is crucial in addressing these impacts,  
and more such initiatives are needed. 
Dr Mahmoud Mohieldin,  
UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for Egypt
 Howden Group Holdings 2023 Sustainability Report

* At COP28 in Dubai, the creation of a Loss and Damage Fund was agreed, with an initial USD 700M 
in pledges. The scope and operating modalities of the fund are yet to be confirmed. Potential L&D 
recipient refers to countries in the Global South with attributes that may qualify for L&D support.
Securing the financial  
future of climate  
vulnerable countries  
Loss and damage (L&D) encompasses the negative 
impacts of climate change that occur despite efforts  
to mitigate and adapt. We believe that the private  
sector has a vital role to play in the global response  
to the challenge that disproportionately affects the 
Global South.
In 2023 we contributed to a report by the University 
of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, 
offering a compelling action plan. The proposed solution 
uses the power of insurance and capital markets 
to dramatically scale up the impact of L&D funding, 
showing that millions of dollars of premium could be 
transformed into billions of dollars of financial protection 
for vulnerable countries across the Global South. 
The research found that the smallest, most vulnerable 
countries currently risk losing over 100% of their GDP 
from extreme climate shocks. Clearly an intolerable 
scenario and adding to this stark reality, these Small 
Island Developing States (SIDS) and other vulnerable 
countries bear these threats almost alone.  
Despite the growing risks, modelling also revealed  
that these economies should remain insurable to  
2050 and beyond. By understanding the risk to the  
entire economy, the research showed how insurance 
can cap the loss of GDP from climate risks at 10% for 
these SIDS and that $1bn of pure premium can secure 
around $75bn of protection. The paper also showed  
how insurance approaches could be scaled to protect 
other potential L&D recipient countries* from their 
highest priority risks. 
We presented this research alongside the University  
of Cambridge at COP28 (see page 16) and called  
upon donors to use the power of insurance and  
capital markets to dramatically scale up the impact  
of L&D funding.  
Since the launch, we have been working hard to turn this 
call to action into a reality. Conversations with potential 
donors continue and awareness is building within the 
L&D community.

As a business spanning more than 100 territories, 
sustainability crosses geographies, teams and 
functions, and requires all parts of our business to work 
together to make progress. As the focus only increases 
and regulations evolve, we are working to minimise our 
environmental footprint. Our commitments are:
Reduce emissions across our buildings,  
business operations, travel and value chain 
wherever possible.  
Reduce waste by working closely with our 
suppliers, to reduce waste generated by our 
offices and employees, and to promote best 
practice amongst our employees, to reduce,  
reuse, and recycle.
Raise awareness by engaging with our 
stakeholders to demonstrate the positive steps 
that our employees, clients, contractors, supply 
chain can take to reduce their impact.
To enable to us to meet our objectives and make  
a positive impact, in 2023 we expanded our specialist 
central sustainability team to match our growing 
commitment to the continual improvement in our 
environmental performance management, to  
support Howden and advise its businesses  
to meet their objectives. 
The team works to provide multiple key services vital 
to achieving our sustainability goals. Supporting the 
Global Leadership team, it provides oversight on key 
environmental issues. 
It also provides our businesses across the world  
with advice and insight on best sustainable practices, 
tracks our environmental impact, maintains up-to-date 
reporting standards to ensure transparency among all 
stakeholders, and assures compliance with all relevant 
environmental laws and regulatory requirements.
We recognise the responsibility we have in tackling 
some of the world’s biggest environmental 
challenges, none more so than climate change.

Greenhouse gas emissions 
In 2023 we laid the groundwork for our environmental 
impact strategy. Our primary goal was to 
comprehensively assess our global emissions.  
In order to overcome the challenges and complexities 
of gathering and managing data in a decentralised 
operating model, we implemented Salesforce’s Net  
Zero Cloud. 
This carbon accounting platform provides us with the 
necessary tools and framework to track, monitor and 
manage our emissions data. 
Working across many offices and retail units globally,  
of which in the majority of cases, we are dependent  
on our landlords to share data on the total building 
usage of gas, electricity, steam and water, along with 
waste stream volumes, from which we then need  
to calculate our usage. 
As we look ahead as a group, our task now is to use  
our data-led insights to develop and set credible  
net-zero goals both in the near and long-term, and  
to build and implement robust carbon reductions 
plans across Howden.
Scope 3 emissions    
Our scope 3 emissions make up the majority of  
our global emissions footprint, and in 2023 we have  
begun to identify with more accuracy the categories in  
which these emissions will be tracked and calculated.  
These include purchased goods and services;  
business travel; waste generated in our operations;  
and employee commuting. 
Given our scale and the multiple geographies across 
which we operate, business travel emissions account  
for a large proportion of our scope 3 emissions.  
Working with a new travel partner, we have enhanced 
our ability to more accurately track employee travel 
emissions across the group and will explore how we 
can reduce our travel impact through and evolving 
technologies and pioneering innovations.
Looking ahead, we are also expanding our sustainable 
procurement efforts, which will better facilitate the 
collection of emissions data based on our purchased 
goods and services.

Supporting carbon 
offset projects   
As a global business with operations across more 
than 115 territories, we have expanded and diversified 
our offset portfolio across multiple geographies to 
select projects that not only mitigate the impact of 
climate and biodiversity but also bring socio-economic 
benefits to local communities that live and work around 
these projects.
TANZANIA
Makame  
savannah redd+ - 
Land grabbing, encroachment 
and conversion of forests to 
agricultural land are all issues 
that contribute to the climate 
and biodiversity crisis. Through 
our funding, we’re helping this 
project to reduce deforestation 
and prevent emissions generated 
through tree harvesting and 
clearing land for agriculture.
MEXICO
Biodigestors
This waste to fuel project reduces 
methane emissions on subsistence 
farms with the help of biodigesters. 
This project increases access to 
biodigesters that transform manure 
into resources that cut down costs 
for farmers. By supporting this 
project, we are aiding the transition 
to regenerative agriculture and 
breaking down financial barriers to 
reduce inequality.
INDIA
Bricks for residential and  
commercial buildings
In India, we’re funding and supporting the 
energy-efficient production of bricks and 
concrete blocks using renewable local 
agricultural biomass in place of fossil fuels. 
Fly ash waste from a nearby thermal power 
plant is integrated into the production 
process, and trapping this waste results  
in less water usage and air pollution. 
PAKISTAN
Delta blue carbon  
mangrove restoration 
The world’s largest blue carbon project 
is rooted in 350,000 hectares of tidal 
wetlands in Pakistan and it supports the 
protection, restoration, and sustainable 
management of a vital mangrove forest 
ecosystem. These wetlands provide fertile 
ground for sequestering and storing vast 
amounts of atmospheric carbon. On top 
of this, the project prevents habitat and 
coastal biodiversity loss, protecting many 
different species of native animals, and 
provides job opportunities to people in  
the local communities. 
UNITED KINGDOM
Regenerative  
farming soil  
carbon credits 
We are keen to support innovative initiatives, 
and Blaston Farm is one of the first projects 
of its kind in the UK to offer measured soil 
carbon credits. By employing methods such 
as direct drilling of arable crops, diverse crop 
rotations and integrated livestock grazing, 
the farm has enhanced its soil health and 
biodiversity; and established a sustainable 
business model, while sequestering carbon. 
MADAGASCAR
Solar and efficient cook stoves 
This project builds and distributes efficient solar cook 
stoves to families and communities in the area to reduce 
open-fire cooking. The project also aids the adoption of this 
more carbon-efficient equipment by providing training and 
educational awareness activities. By doing so, the scheme 
aims to reduce deforestation and air pollution while increasing 
local employment and alleviating a significant financial burden 
faced by low-income households in Madagascar.

Waste   
We have continued to take a holistic approach 
to waste production by supporting reduction 
projects internally and externally. Across the 
globe, we encourage employees, suppliers 
and landlords from who we rent office space, 
to take action to reduce their waste. 
We aim to replace paper with electronic 
media while providing recycling bins for paper, 
cardboard, glass, and batteries, and actively 
encourage employees to reduce, reuse and 
recycle their waste.
Such measures include: Howden Spain 
removed all plastic from the office; Howden 
Hellas (Greece) have reduced paper and ink 
usage by 80%; and Howden Hong Kong have 
provided all employees with reusable lunch 
boxes, cutlery and coffee cups.
In the UK, we also source Forestry 
Stewardship Council paper for use in all our 
printers and recycle toner cartridges. We 
have recycled notepad paper, biros, and other 
stationery where possible. 
Restore UK   
In the UK, we have a partnership with Restore plc to 
reuse or recycle all our old IT equipment. Through this 
we have saved over 8,316,168 KWh, the equivalent of 
the average energy supply for 1,512 homes for a year.

Seven Clean Seas 
Our collaboration with Seven Cleans Seas continues to 
go from strength to strength. An organisation dedicated 
to addressing the plastic pollution crisis in Southeast 
Asia, our partnership began in 2020, initially rooted in 
educational beach clean-up initiatives. Over time, our 
shared commitment to addressing plastic pollution 
has evolved into not only addressing the plastic 
pollution crisis but also supporting Seven Clean Seas 
in their ambitions to create a world where education, 
employment and equal opportunities can forge a 
brighter tomorrow.  
Together we’ve successfully removed 287,532kg  
of plastic waste from beaches and mangroves, 
accounting for our global plastic footprint spanning  
54 countries.
Social impact is at the core of all Seven Clean Seas 
projects, and in the local communities where they 
operate, they have provided 88 formal jobs to  
waste collectors. 
These people were recruited and trained directly 
from the local community. As part of its commitment 
to supporting employee wellbeing, the organisation 
provides comprehensive support, including social 
security and healthcare benefits, whilst also ensuring 
that all their employment opportunities are inclusive, 
with a strong focus on empowering women  
to promote gender equality.
Case study
Nature and  
biodiversity 
In 2023, we carried out work to better 
understand how we as a business can  
support our ecosystems and minimise  
the impact we have on nature and the  
local environment. We will use the output  
of this research to inform our nature and 
biodiversity strategy.
 
Water  
Although climate change will have the greatest 
impact on our planet, water and  
its scarcity poses an even more imminent 
threat to many around the world. Although  
our business operations have minimal water 
use and impact, we will look at how and  
where we can reduce our water use.

Reciprocal mentoring  
in UK and APAC
Our reciprocal mentoring continued to grow its reach 
across regions. Following a successful pilot in the UK  
in 2022, we rolled it out into our APAC region.
With more than 50 colleagues taking part, the initiative 
aims to create a global network of mentorship, fostering 
cross-regional connections, and promoting diverse 
perspectives. Through mentorship, we seek to cultivate 
an environment that encourages continuous learning, 
understanding, and collaboration.
Diversity and  
inclusion dashboard
In 2023, we successfully integrated the diversity  
and inclusion dashboard into our Board packs.  
This dynamic tool has changed the way we measure, 
monitor, and communicate our progress.
The dashboard serves stakeholders a comprehensive 
view of our ongoing diversity efforts and allows us to 
quantify and identify opportunities enabling us to  
adapt and improve continually.
Menopause  
benefit launch
Taking a step further in our commitment to employee 
well-being, in partnership with our Women’s Health 
employee resource group (ERG), we introduced  
a menopause benefit for colleagues in the UK as part  
of our comprehensive employee benefits package. 
In 2024, we will be continuing our partnership with 
Henpicked, a leader in providing training on menopause 
at work. We will be rolling out training for all employees 
to raise awareness and provide practical tips for those 
who are experiencing menopause and to those who are 
supporting someone going through it at work and/or in 
their personal lives.
Diversity  
roundtables 
Improving our awareness, skills and behaviours  
is crucial to building a shared understanding and 
inclusive workplace where we can harness our  
collective power to drive change. 
For us, this starts with curiosity and conversation and 
that is why, in 2023, we launched diversity roundtables  
to create opportunities for us to talk openly, honestly 
and freely, and to learn from each-others’ experiences.
Through these roundtables, we have seen an increase  
in conversation around inclusion and a deeper 
awareness and understanding of diversity and inclusion 
topics. Following the success and positive feedback  
in the UK, we will continuing to roll these out across 
Howden in 2024.

The Prince’s Trust –  
Get Into Insurance  
programme 
Embarking on an unexpected yet transformative journey, 
Naomie Vunabandi, Marketing Operations Manager – 
Howden, found her way into the insurance industry through 
The Prince’s Trust Get Into Insurance programme. 
Through a partnership with the charity, we offer young 
people aged 18-30 the chance to join the Get Into Insurance 
programme, a two-week immersive work experience 
programme where they can join us to learn more about  
the world of insurance and the London market. 
Following the huge success of the first programme in 2022, 
where 80% of participants were placed in roles at Howden 
and the wider London insurance market. Howden welcomed 
back a second cohort in 2023.

 Howden Group Holdings 2023 Sustainability Report 
Being a responsible business
In 2022, I saw a post on LinkedIn advertising the Get Into Insurance 
Programme, a two-week in-person introduction to insurance with 
on-the-job work experience and professional skills development. 
Having limited prior knowledge of the insurance industry, I decided 
to apply on a whim. Unbeknownst to me, this opportunity would go 
on to play a huge part in shaping my career path, and my personal 
and professional development.  
Throughout the two-week programme, I engaged in team-building 
activities, developed my communication and presentation skills, 
and worked alongside individuals from diverse academic and 
cultural backgrounds, all significantly boosting my confidence  
in the workplace. 
Shadowing Howden colleagues in differing roles, going on 
company visits, speaking to industry experts, and networking 
opportunities helped me gain an insight into the vast possibilities 
within the insurance sector. I also had the chance to hear from 
Howden CEO David Howden, and learning about his journey into 
the industry convinced me that a career in insurance was for me.
The programme not only expanded my understanding of the 
insurance landscape but also inspired my own self-belief. 
Encounters with industry professionals, including leaders 
from Howden, provided me with valuable insights and the 
encouragement to pursue a career in insurance. 
With newfound confidence, I embraced the challenge of 
transitioning from a culinary background as a chef, and  
started applying for roles at Howden. 
Two years into this journey, I now proudly work as a Marketing 
Operations Manager, focusing on our global employee benefits 
domain, and Howden’s commitment to nurturing talent has helped 
me to grow exponentially. I wouldn’t be where I am in my career 
if not for the Get Into Insurance programme and the support of 
Howden, The Prince’s Trust and LIIBA (London & International 
Insurance Brokers’ Association).  
Beyond my professional role, I am passionate about philanthropy, 
and co-founded a charity in Democratic Republic of the Congo 
in 2017 aimed at improving the lives of underprivileged children. 
This commitment is driven by a deep belief in empowering young 
people to recognise and embrace their worth and is reflected in 
Howden’s ethos of giving back.

Employee  
resource groups 
In 2023, we witnessed significant growth in 
our employee resource groups (ERGs), with 
their events gaining prominence across the 
organisation. These groups bring leaders and 
colleagues together to provide forums for 
people from under-represented backgrounds 
and their allies to drive change and deepen 
the value of inclusion across Howden. 
The increased participation and impact of 
ERGs reflect our commitment to providing  
a platform for diverse voices to be heard  
and acknowledged.

Women’s  
Health
The Women’s Health hosted a panel in partnership with Henpicked on ‘The Taboos 
of Menopause’ where we got to hear to from experts in the field as well as colleagues 
from Howden who sheared their own experiences. They also invited former Olympian 
Sarah Lewis OBE to come and talk to us about her experiences of competing in the 
1988 Winter Olympics and her transition from a champion to an inspiring leader. In her 
talk, Sarah exposed the reality and challenges of working in a male-dominated industry, 
connecting the need to empower others and encourage inclusivity in the workplace.
Disability  
inclusion 
Disability inclusion  collaborate with leadership to support colleagues with disabilities 
including raising awareness about disability-related issues and ensuring that policies  
and practices are inclusive for colleagues with disabilities. In 2023, the ERG proudly 
hosted Jessikah Inaba, the UK’s first black and blind barrister, in order to learn from  
her own career journey, as well as further develop our colleagues’ understanding of 
disability issues.
Multiculturalism  
Multiculturalism come together to advocate, educate, promote and drive representation 
of multiculturalism at Howden. In the year the ERG celebrated Diwali with Henna painting 
and a specialised menu in our offices, hosted a multiculturalism fair where members 
brought in various cuisines to celebrate their heritage and share with colleagues and. 
As part of Black History month, the Multiculturalism ERG also hosted a talk with Jason 
Robinson OBE, the first Black man to captain the England rugby union team as well as 
former British Lion. Jason spoke to the importance of reimagining a future that cherishes 
and embraces the cultural heritage and contributions of Black individuals worldwide. 
Parents  
at Work
Parents at Work campaign for inclusion and better awareness around the  
challenges parents and carers face in the workplace. In 2023, the ERG  released  
a podcast where they spoke about accepting, including, celebrating and supporting 
neurodivergent children.
LGBTQ+ 
Our LGBTQ+ and Allies Network come together to support and advocate a supportive 
and inclusive workplace culture for colleagues regardless of sexual orientation or gender 
identity. The ERG continued their partnership with LINK, the LGBTQ+ Insurance Network, 
hosting a Drag Bingo event in our Howden offices that raised £7,000 for Terrence 
Higgins Trust charity

Gender pay gap 
The report details the gender pay gap  data taken on 5 April 2023  
from across our UK businesses under our Howden Group Services 
employing entity. 
Since the snapshot data of the 2022 report, we have made several 
acquisitions, including Aston Lark, A-Plan and KGM. This  means the 
population we are reporting on has grown from 2,485  employees to  
5,779 employees and accordingly the data reflects a significantly  
different workforce.

The data shows a reduction in both our median hourly gender pay gap and 
median bonus pay gap compared to April 2022, reflecting the increase 
of women now represented in the upper quartile (from 17.3% in 2022 to 
27.5% for the year) and the upper mid quartile (from 32.6% in 2022 to 
48.0% in 2023). We have seen a slight increase in the mean hourly gender 
pay gap (from 42.48% in 2022 to 45.10% for the year) as women remain 
underrepresented in the upper quartile. We have seen an overall reduction  
in the percentage of colleagues receiving a bonus at the 2023 snapshot.  
This is because acquisitions where a smaller proportion of employees that 
are eligible to receive a bonus came into scope for this year’s analysis.
We recognise that the gender pay gap is a complex issue influenced  
by various factors such as access to opportunities, career progression,  
and representation in senior leadership roles.
As such, we continue to implement targeted initiatives to address  
these challenges and promote gender equality across Howden.  
Further information on these initiatives can be found in our

strategy at Howden. Enabling our colleagues to  
balance and enhance their overall wellbeing is central 
to our culture. By having the opportunity to engage in 
wellbeing activities flexibly, whether individually or in 
groups, in person or virtually, provides our colleagues 
with the freedom to build wellbeing into their working 
and personal lives based on their circumstances.
We provide and promote a variety of forums, tools and 
education opportunities that support psychological, 
emotional, financial and social wellbeing. 
Howden also provides financial education, virtual 
counselling and wellness applications, and a 
combination of webinars and live presentations  
in relation to physical, mental health and wider  
wellbeing topics. 
Colleague engagement
We offer colleagues different forums to share thoughts 
and opinions including through ERGs [see page 29] 
and listening forums. To help us assess and monitor 
employee satisfaction and engagement, we welcome 
colleagues to participate in our global people survey  
to give everyone the opportunity to provide feedback  
on their experience of working at Howden. 
As we grow, it is important that we understand what 
matters to our people the most, so we equip leaders  
with the knowledge to drive improve and remain aligned 
with the goals and values of Howden.

Our Board drives our 
strategic objectives as a 
business. The roles of the 
Chairman and CEO are 
separate to encourage 
a strong and healthy 
decision-making process.  
The Board comprises the Chairman, CEO, CFO and  
10 non-executive directors. They bring diverse skills  
and views to the Board thanks to their experience on 
various external advisory and insurance-sector boards 
including changing regulatory and business landscapes,  
sustainability, and diversity and inclusion.
Sustainability governance   
Sustainability is on the agenda at both Board and  
Group Executive Committee meetings. With Board 
members chairing the ESG & Sustainability  
Committee and the Diversity and Inclusion Committee, 
there is direct communication between the decision 
makers and the committees.
As well as being chaired by a Non-Executive Director 
of the Board, the ESG & Sustainability Committee also 
comprises of members of our senior management. 
We continue to review our committees, structure and 
members to ensure they are fit for purpose in this 
changing climate.
We have clear policies and systems in place to ensure 
high standards across fundamental issues like data 
protection, financial crime, cyber security, human rights, 
and supporting employee wellbeing.

Human rights and  
labour rights    
Howden is committed to being a responsible global 
business, recognising the importance and advancement 
of human rights as an issue that is integral to our core 
business, our operations, and us as employers across  
all our entities worldwide. 
We support the principles contained within the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Labour Organization Core Conventions on Labour 
Standards. The business does not tolerate the use of 
forced labour or child labour and has zero tolerance 
for slavery or trafficking in human beings. To date no 
infringements on human rights have been reported. 
Any human rights risk identified would be escalated 
through the appropriate governance channels to 
address and remedy. Read our 2023 Modern 
Slavery Statement
Financial crime
The Group has a zero tolerance approach to all types  
of financial crime including bribery and corruption. 
The controls in place include: group level minimum 
standards policy; trading entities policies and 
procedures; annual mandatory on-line training  
for all staff; client screening to identify politically 
exposed persons and adverse media exposure;  
financial crime risk assessment; whistleblowing  
policy and anonymous speak-up call service; full 
registration requirements of all given and received  
gifts and entertainment with compliance oversight  
and challenge; and compliance oversight and  
approval of all charitable and corporate donations.
Whistleblowing    
As an employee-led organisation, the business takes 
any form of wrongdoing very seriously. The wellbeing 
and integrity of our employees and business is of 
paramount importance to us and for that reason, we 
encourage all individuals to raise any concerns that they 
may have about the conduct of others in the business or 
the way in which the business is run.
As part of our whistleblowing reporting process, we 
use Safecall, a global, independent and confidential 
reporting service.
Safecall provides a completely confidential service to 
individuals who wish to raise any concerns they have, 
if for any reason they are unable to do so with their line 
manager in the first instance. Contact details are also 
available via the company website, for external third 
parties or counterparties e.g. customers, suppliers and 
business partners.

Risk management    
The Group is a large and diverse organisation, which 
increasingly faces a broad range of risks affecting 
various aspects of the organisation, which could impact 
financial results, reputational image, operations or 
strategic decisions, to name a few. In order to achieve 
management’s objectives and expectations for the 
business, it is necessary to manage its risks effectively 
whilst striving to preserve value through a robust risk 
management framework.
A Group Risk Management framework has been 
established and is being embedded, which seeks to 
ensure the identification and monitoring of pertinent 
risks across the organisation, supporting informed 
decision making, and ensuring that appropriate internal 
controls are designed to mitigate the downside and 
maximise the potential upside of risks. Under the 
framework, entities will align their identified risks to  
a standardised Group Risk Library, from which key risks 
are consolidated and reported upward to the Board.
ESG risk 
The ESG & Sustainability Committee sits under the 
Board to report on ESG risks. Through delegating 
certain responsibilities to management, the Board has 
in place appropriate structures and processes to enable 
accountability to stakeholders and to evidence the 
management of such risk. All roles at entity, regional and 
Group level aim to work together collectively to align with 
each other on ESG initiatives and the management’s 
responses to ESG risks.
Cyber security     
Cyber security and protection of our data and assets  
is one of our highest priorities. We continue to invest  
in sustainable technologies which help mature our 
security posture, and increase governance and 
operational resilience. 
As part of our Information Security policy, we operate 
staff training and phishing testing to raise cyber 
awareness and maintain safe behaviour.

Partner ecosystem      
To help achieve our sustainability goals, a trusted 
network of strategic delivery partners and vendors 
whose sustainability priorities are aligned to our own 
is key. Collaboration is vital – with the right partners, 
who are investing in developing sustainable products, 
supporting energy efficiency and the transition to  
clean energy, and helping mitigate the impacts of 
climate change.  
We have introduced a vendor risk management  
tool to assess vendor engagements including ESG  
risk, where appropriate vendors will then be subject  
to third-party monitoring and required to complete  
due diligence questionnaires. More than 100 vendors 
are recorded on it at group level, and work continues to 
include both new and existing vendors and the testing of 
the application with international Howden entities.
Supply chain     
Being a responsible business extends to our supply 
chain and responsible sourcing. 
Due to the nature of our business and size of many 
of our offices, we have a decentralised procurement 
model, which utilises local buying and operational  
team members. 
Each business is managed in-country, with policies 
and procedures in place where relevant and required, 
adapted to meet local regulation, requirements  
and practices, and to best manage our businesses 
and suppliers.
A local approach       
We have a local approach to sourcing goods and 
services across geographies. In the UK we are working 
with contractors and suppliers who share our zero 
tolerance approach to modern slavery, and support 
environmental accountability and compliance with all 
relevant standards, laws and regulations.  
This work continues to progress as we grow as a 
business. In 2024, we will be working with a consultancy 
to review and update our Supplier Code of Conduct. This 
will set the expectations of our suppliers on key ethical, 
social and environmental principles including human 
rights and labour practices.

Group Giving platform     
Our Group Giving platform (powered by Benevity) 
efficiently streamlines our global volunteering and 
fundraising activity. This centralised hub offers a wide 
variety of opportunities, and inspires and assists our 
people in their giving endeavours. 
The platform is available to all colleagues and serves as 
a catalyst for engagement, empowering them to make a 
difference for the causes close to their hearts.
The platform not only showcases the impact of their 
efforts and the difference they are making to other 
people’s lives, but also identifies the most supported 
causes, enabling us to design the most impactful 
programmes for our people. 
Having a single source of information for colleagues 
that offers global volunteering opportunities, as well 
as global causes to support through fundraising and 
donations, has proved hugely successful in supporting 
our teams, and those in need, worldwide.
As a growing group, we continue to get more and more 
colleagues engaged with the platform through activation 
calls, demos, and internal campaigns.

Humanitarian  
appeals
Over the past year, our global team rallied behind three 
significant humanitarian causes: the earthquakes in 
Turkey and Syria, the earthquake in Morocco, and 
the floods in Libya. Our people demonstrated their 
generosity, collectively contributing over £40,000  
to support these critical appeals.
The Howden Foundation further magnified this by 
matching employee donations, generously providing 
£15,500 in matched funding, with an additional direct 
donation of £33,500 to the Turkey appeal. 
This resulted in a substantial total contribution of  
£93,500, providing crucial aid to those affected by  
these urgent crises.
Building on this impactful initiative, we have introduced 
dedicated humanitarian appeal pages on our Group 
Giving platform for the Red Cross and the International 
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 
(IFRC). 
These pages serve as efficient channels, allowing our 
colleagues to contribute swiftly and effectively when 
confronted with future environmental or humanitarian 
crises. Through these ongoing efforts, we aim to 
continue fostering a culture of support and rapid 
response within our global community.

Global Group  
Giving Month     
Following the success of our previous year’s Global 
Group Giving Week campaign, we decided to go bigger 
and hold a Global Group Giving Month (GGGM) over 
the whole month of May to create more opportunities 
to make a positive difference to the communities and 
charities in which we live and work. 
The theme for GGGM in 2023 was ‘Year of the Team’, 
and teams around the world came together to volunteer, 
fundraise, and host sporting challenges and events  
– all focussed around giving back.
For this year’s ‘Global Group Giving Month’, we donated 
blood, cleaned beaches, helped out at animal shelters, 
planted mangroves and distributed food. We ran, cycled, 
rowed, danced and walked and raised awareness of 
important causes.
Together, we raised over £144,000, volunteered  
over 4,250 hours and supported over 110  
charities worldwide.

Supporting  
communities  
aross India 
Throughout 2023, colleagues at Howden India 
showcased their commitment to giving back by  
focusing their efforts on bolstering education  
and skill development for underprivileged students  
and youth in India.
A standout effort involved sponsoring a 45-day skill 
development workshop aimed at preparing marginalised 
youth for grey-collar jobs like engineers, healthcare 
workers, and IT specialists. This initiative directly 
addressed unemployment challenges, empowering over 
1,000 young people with crucial employable skills.
Additionally, Howden India collaborated with Round 
Table India to contribute to essential infrastructure  
for schools. Their support in constructing school  
toilets directly benefited approximately 400 students. 
They also helped to build five new classrooms across 
two local administration-run schools, aiming to alleviate 
overcrowding issues and create a conducive learning 
environment for hundreds of students. 
In alignment with their commitment to digital 
empowerment, Howden India partnered with Udaan to 
distribute 40 laptops to high-performing students from 
low-income families. This endeavour focused  
on bridging the digital divide, enabling equitable  
access to technology for those most in need.
By investing in education and skill development, Howden 
India is making significant strides towards breaking 
the cycle of poverty, promoting social inclusion, and 
fostering sustainable economic growth in the region.

The foundation in numbers (as of 30 September 2023):
In our commitment to sustainability, we hold a fundamental  
belief that a thriving business must prioritise the wellbeing of  
people, communities, and the global environment – both now  
and for future generations. 
One of the ways we do this is through our corporate 
foundation, an independent registered charity with  
a mission to protect people from the social and 
economic impacts of climate change. Since 2014  
we have financially supported the Howden Foundation*, 
enabling it to address some of the most pressing 
challenges humanity faces. 
Now, as we face the biggest threat of our age, the 
Foundation has undertaken a renewed commitment; 
to support initiatives that not only mitigate disaster risk 
but also adapt to climate change, ultimately enhancing 
the resilience of high-risk communities worldwide. 
Through long-term partnerships, the Foundation 
provides financial support and actively seeks 
opportunities to extend its impact beyond  
traditional grant funding, tapping into the diverse  
skills and expertise of our people worldwide. 
The Foundation further amplifies its impact by  
supporting the charitable giving initiatives of our 
employees. The People First Fund offers matched 
funding for colleagues’ charitable donations and 
individual fundraising activities. This support ensures 
that our employees’ efforts in contributing to charitable 
causes reach even greater heights. 
Additionally, the Foundation supports the Howden 
Giving Back Celebration Campaign – an annual initiative 
that celebrates and recognises non-profit organisations 
making a significant difference in the communities  
where our people live and work by awarding these 
organisations with a financial contribution in order 
to further their vital work.
Established in 2014, the Howden 
Foundation is the corporate 
Foundation of Howden, extending 
the charitable work of the business 
and its people around the world
*The Howden Foundation is the working name of the Howden Group Foundation, a registered charity in England and Wales (Charity Number 1156286).
