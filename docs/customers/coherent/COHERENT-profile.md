## Carbon Reporting Strategy

**Reporting Scope:** Scope 3 (purchased goods & services focus)
**Primary Goal:** Enable supplier emissions reduction
**Customer Drivers:** Downstream customer pressure for Scope 3 reductions
**Timeline:** Urgent - need to demonstrate progress "fast enough"

**Key Initiatives:**

1. **Category Manager Enablement**
   - Training sessions completed on DitchCarbon platform
   - Category managers learning to access supplier disclosure status
   - Understanding supplier targets and progress
   - Identifying non-disclosing suppliers

2. **Chief Supply Chain Officer Engagement**
   - Presentation scheduled: Week of November 3rd
   - Topics: Supplier disclosure rates, data availability, engagement strategy
   - Early feedback: Very positive and supportive

3. **Supplier Engagement Program**
   - **Phase 1 (Current):** Informational letters to suppliers
   - **Phase 2 (Next):** Action requests (disclosure, reduction plans, target setting)
   - **Tools being evaluated:**
     - DitchCarbon supplier claim profile (NEW - launched Oct 30)
     - Microsoft Excel tracking sheet (Alexa created)
   - **Decision pending:** Which tool to use for supplier data collection

---

## Supplier Engagement Strategy

### Current State
- Using "industry standard" emissions factors from DitchCarbon for non-disclosing suppliers
- Tracking which suppliers disclose to CDP
- Category managers being trained to identify gaps
- Preparing supplier outreach materials

### Planned Approach

**Letter Campaign:**
1. **Informational letter:** "This will be expected going forward"
2. **Action request letter:** "Please disclose or provide data directly to Coherent"

**Data Collection Options:**

**Option A: DitchCarbon Supplier Claim Profile** (NEW - Oct 30, 2025)
- Suppliers claim their profile on DitchCarbon platform
- See their scorecard as evaluated by Coherent
- View recommendations for emissions reduction
- Upload missing documents/data directly
- **Benefits:**
  - One source of truth
  - Automated data ingestion
  - Suppliers get free access to recommendations
  - Reduces manual spreadsheet management
- **Demo video:** Alex sending later today (Oct 30)

**Option B: Microsoft Excel Sheet** (Alexa's creation)
- Custom tracking spreadsheet
- Manual data collection and entry
- Requires reconciliation with DitchCarbon
- **Benefits:**
  - Familiar format
  - Full control over fields

**Decision Timeline:** TBD after demo video review

### Supplier Recommendations Feature
- DitchCarbon generates reduction recommendations based on peer companies
- Case studies from similar companies already reducing emissions
- **Use case:** "Here's what you should do to improve" → supplier gets actionable guidance
- **Coherent benefit:** Suppliers get value from engagement (not just data request)

## Data Ingestion & Timeline

### Historical Data (Completed)
- **2023, 2024, 2025:** 3 years of spend data in main project
- **Consolidation:** "Other expenses" rows for spend <£10k (BU + L2 level)
- **Result:** Manageable view for category managers

### Q1 2026 Data (In Progress)

**Submission:** Completed (week of Oct 21-28, 2025)
**Status:** Ready for DitchCarbon ingestion
**Timeline:** ~1 week for processing (if no questions arise)
**Project Structure:** Separate project for partial year

**Rationale for Separate Project:**
- Avoid showing partial year in "Monitor" tab (absolute numbers not comparable)
- Intensity metrics still useful for partial year
- Will merge into main project once full 2026 data available (end of year)

**Data Processing:**

| Date | Event | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| ~Oct 21-28 | Valerie submits Q1 2026 spend file | Coherent | ✅ Complete |
| ~Oct 30 - Nov 6 | DitchCarbon processes data | Alex / Varun | In Progress |
| ~Nov 6 | Questions resolved (if any) | Both parties | Pending |
| ~Nov 13 | Q1 2026 data live in platform | DitchCarbon | Expected |

**Future Quarters:**
- **Q2 2026:** Submit Q2 data separately OR combined Q1+Q2 file
- **Q3 2026:** Same approach
- **Q4 2026 / Full Year:** Submit complete 2026 file → merge into main project

### Data Consolidation Questions (Resolved)

**Question:** How to match Q1 2026 rows to existing rows in main project?
- **Answer:** Not needed - separate project until full year available
- **Supplier names:** Using normalized names (clean, consistent)
- **Changes:** Minimal (only on tail-end suppliers, not main spend)

**Question:** Apply same 10k threshold to partial year?
- **Answer:** Yes - keep £10,000 threshold for consistency
- **Logic:** BU + L2 concatenated (same as historical)
- **Result:** Tail spend consolidated, focus on meaningful suppliers

## CDP Data & Supplier Disclosure

### CDP Access Strategy

**Current State:**
- DitchCarbon purchases disclosure status & scores from CDP
- Does NOT have full CDP data access (too expensive)
- Proactively aggregates public CDP disclosures from supplier websites

**CDP Negotiation (Ongoing):**
- DitchCarbon negotiating to purchase full CDP data directly
- **Challenge:** CDP becoming "more and more difficult to work with"
- **Expected outcome:** CDP will ask "ridiculous amount of money"
- **Likely result:** DitchCarbon will NOT purchase (can get most data free via scraping)

**Alternative Approach:**
- Continue proactive aggregation of public CDP reports
- Use supplier claim profile feature to encourage suppliers to upload CDP reports directly
- Send suppliers link to claim profile → they upload missing data themselves

**For Coherent:**
- If DitchCarbon sees CDP disclosure = TRUE but no data available → reach out to supplier
- Supplier can upload CDP report to their claimed profile
- Goes through DitchCarbon QA process → added to supplier record
- **Timeline:** ~30 seconds for supplier to claim profile and upload

### CDP Timeline Challenges

**Submission:** Companies submit to CDP in September
**Scores Released:** January (4-month lag)
**Data Availability for Buyers:** Earlier than scores (supply chain members get access sooner)

**Richard's Note:** Customers with CDP Supply Chain membership poke Coherent about data "months before the score comes up"
