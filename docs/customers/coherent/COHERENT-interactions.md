**Veronika Introduction:**
- Based in Bulgaria
- With DitchCarbon since mid-July 2025 (~3 months)
- Supports operations and customer success (QA side)
- Previously at Emitwise (competitor that "went bust")
- DitchCarbon "lucky to pick up Veronica" after Emitwise closure

**Varun (Moka) Introduction:**
- Based in Berlin, Germany
- Day 3 at DitchCarbon (just joined this week)
- Joining product ops team with Veronika and Alex
- Background: Research on Scope 3 emissions throughout career post-graduation
- 4 years in Berlin
- "Really excited to join DitchCarbon and talk to you guys on Scope 3 emissions"

**Coherent Context (Alex):**
- Partnership duration: "Better part of a year" (~12 months)
- Working closely with Richard, Alexa, and Valerie
- Delivered disclosures and enabled their team
- Focus: Supplier emissions tracking and reporting

---

### Agenda Setting (2:33 - 4:11)

**Primary Topic:** Getting caught up on latest input file

**Alex's Questions:** Sent last week on data input file

**Additional Topics Raised by Richard:**
1. **Ingesting new data** (highest priority)
2. **CDP data timeline** - when to expect updated results
3. **Industry standard emissions factors update** - longer-term action
4. **Supplier maturity module** - progress update

**Time Constraint:** Alex needs to end at 30min mark (another call scheduled)

---

### CDP Data Access Discussion (4:11 - 10:02)

#### Current State

**What DitchCarbon Has:**
- Disclosure status (yes/no) for all companies
- CDP scores (purchased directly from CDP)
- Publicly available CDP data (when suppliers make it public on their websites)

**What DitchCarbon Does NOT Have:**
- Full CDP database access (behind paywall)
- Direct access to CDP disclosures (unless made public by company)

#### CDP Negotiation Update

**Status:** In negotiations with CDP to purchase data outright
**Challenge:** "CDP are becoming more and more difficult to work with in general"
**Alex's Prediction:** "They are going to ask for a ridiculous amount of money for something that we can mostly get ourselves for free"
**Expected Outcome:** Will NOT purchase directly from CDP

**Rationale:**
- Most data available via public disclosures (free)
- Proactive aggregation sufficient for most needs
- Cost not justified for incremental data gain

#### CDP Public Disclosure History (Richard's Context)

**Timeline Changes:**
- **2+ years ago:** CDP public disclosures were actually public (free access)
- **~1.5 years ago:** CDP put disclosures behind paywall

**Coherent's Past Experience:**
- Looked at purchasing CDP dataset years ago
- Intern (Alexa) manually downloaded and read ~100 CDP reports (painful process)
- **Benefit of dataset:** Avoids manual work, provides structured download
- **Cost:** High (didn't purchase)

**Coherent's CDP Process:**
- Check box: "Willing to make public with CDP"
- Do NOT put CDP download directly on corporate website
- Instead: Same data published in ESG/sustainability report on website

**Implication:** DitchCarbon will pick up Coherent's sustainability report (public on website), not CDP disclosure (behind CDP paywall)

#### Richard's Question: What Data Would DitchCarbon Actually Pick Up?

**Answer (Alex):**
- Both ESG report AND CDP disclosure (if both publicly available on supplier website)
- If supplier discloses different data to CDP vs. ESG report → both get merged into overall supplier record
- **For Coherent specifically:** Since they don't publish CDP disclosure on website, only ESG report picked up
- **For CDP access:** Would need to pay CDP directly

**Coherent's Case:**
- No difference between CDP disclosure and sustainability report (same data)
- DitchCarbon picks up publicly hosted sustainability report
- CDP disclosure only accessible via CDP paywall purchase

#### DitchCarbon's Workaround: Supplier Claim Profile

**New Feature (Launching Today - Oct 30):**
- Suppliers can "claim their profiles" on DitchCarbon platform
- Gain access to everything Coherent sees about them
- Encouraged to upload any missing data (including CDP reports)
- Data goes through DitchCarbon QA process
- **Timeline:** Supplier can claim profile and upload in ~30 seconds

**How It Works:**
1. Coherent sends supplier link to their profile
2. Supplier claims profile (verifies they are that company)
3. Supplier sees their scorecard, data sources, emissions data
4. Supplier uploads missing data (CDP report, sustainability report, etc.)
5. DitchCarbon QA reviews and adds to profile
6. Data becomes visible to Coherent

**Benefits:**
- Bypasses CDP paywall
- Increases data coverage
- Encourages supplier disclosure
- Suppliers get value (see recommendations, scorecard)

#### CDP Score vs. Data Timing (Richard)

**Observation:** CDP supply chain members get data access earlier than score release

**Timeline:**
- **Submission:** September
- **Score Release:** January (expected)
- **Data Availability for Buyers:** Months earlier (Richard gets questions before scores published)

**Example:** Customers with CDP Supply Chain membership contact Coherent with data questions "months before the score comes up"

#### DitchCarbon's Follow-Up Approach

**Identified Gap:** CDP disclosure = TRUE, but no data available
- **Action:** Reach out to supplier directly
- **Request:** "Upload your CDP report" (via supplier claim profile)
- **Ease:** "Pretty easy for us. We'll probably just do that honestly ourselves"

**Alex's Commitment:** If gap identified, DitchCarbon will handle supplier outreach proactively

---

### Industry Emissions Factor Update & Supplier Maturity Module (11:20 - 11:25)

#### Industry Emissions Factor Update

**Status:** Scheduled but not yet live
**Timeline:** Not expected before December 2025
**Reason:** Behind other priorities (supplier claim profile, supplier maturity module)

#### Supplier Maturity Module

**Status:** Coming after supplier claim profile
**Timeline:** Expected 2-4 weeks after current launch (early-mid November)
**Richard's Note:** "That was the other one I was thinking of"

---

### Data Input File Questions (11:25 - 23:38)

**Context:** Alex shares screen to review specific questions about Q1 2026 spend file submission

#### Question 1: Matching New Rows to Previous Rows (Point 3 informs Point 1)

**Background:**
- Coherent providing Q1 2026 (half year spend)
- Main project has 3 years of historical data (2023, 2024, 2025)

**Question:** Merge Q1 2026 into existing project, or keep separate?

**Consideration (Alex):**
- Previously commented that partial year in "Monitor" tab not helpful
- **Intensity numbers:** Can be compared with partial year (no issue)
- **Absolute numbers:** Not comparable with partial year (misleading)

**Valerie's Decision:**
- **Preference:** Separate project for partial year
- **Condition:** "As long as at the end of the year, then we can merge it back and have it all in the one project"

**Alex's Confirmation:** "That's easy to do"

**Follow-Up Question (Alex):** Can supplier names be mapped between Q1 2026 and historical data?

**Sub-Question 1a: Supplier Name Changes**

**Context:**
- Coherent previously changed internal department names
- Question: Have supplier names changed?

**Valerie's Answer:**
- **No changes** to supplier names
- Using "normalized names" (clean, standardized)
- **Might be 1-2 changes** for cleanup (on tail end, not main spend suppliers)
- **Main spend suppliers:** Names "scrubbed and super clean" (highly visible, no changes)
- **Q1 2026 names should match historical:** If they don't match, likely new suppliers

**Implication:** Matching will be straightforward (minimal risk of duplicates)

#### Question 2: Consolidated Project with 2026 Data (Looking Ahead)

**Context:** When full 2026 data is ready to merge into main project

**Goal:** One row per supplier (avoid duplicate rows for same supplier across different years)

**Matching Challenge:**
- Same supplier with 2023/2024/2025 data (existing row)
- Adding 2026 data → should merge into same row, not create new row
- **Risk:** If slight differences in inputs, system may create duplicate rows

**Alex's Suggestion (for end of year):**
- **Option A (Foolproof):** Provide one clean spend input with all years (2023-2026) in single file
  - DitchCarbon overwrites entire project with new "golden record" file
  - Zero risk of duplicates
  - Simplest approach
- **Option B (Matching):** Provide only 2026 data, DitchCarbon matches to existing rows
  - DitchCarbon will try to avoid duplicates
  - Risk: Slight formatting differences → duplicate rows for same supplier
  - DitchCarbon will flag ambiguous cases for resolution

**Question for Coherent:** Can you easily export current year + past years' spend data in one file?

**Valerie's Response:**
- Don't need to decide until close to end of year
- Question noted for future planning

**Alex's Note:**
- Will manage either way
- If ambiguous cases arise, will let Coherent know
- Not a big deal either way

#### Question 3: Consolidating Small Spend Rows ("Other Expenses")

**Historical Methodology (2023-2025):**
- Consolidate rows under £10k total spend (cumulatively across 3 years)
- **Consolidation level:** BU (Business Unit) + L2 (Category Level 2) concatenated
- **Result:** Thousands of rows → manageable thousands (maybe ~20+ "Other Expenses" rows)

**Question for Q1 2026 (Partial Year):**
- Apply same logic? Or adjust threshold given only 1 quarter of data?

**Valerie's Question:** "When we provide next quarter, what happens?"

**Sub-Question 3a: Quarterly Data Submission Approach**

**Valerie:** "Are we expecting to provide Q1 and Q2 on same file, or just Q2 and DitchCarbon merges the two?"

**Alex's Answer:** "Always depends on what's easier for you"

**Option A (Easier for DitchCarbon):**
- Provide Q1+Q2 combined file
- No risk of creating duplicate rows for same supplier

**Option B (Also supported):**
- Provide Q2 separately
- DitchCarbon maps Q2 data back to Q1 data in same project
- **Condition:** Easy to map if formatting consistent between Q1 and Q2
- **Risk:** Weird formatting issues between files → mapping challenges

**Alex's Expectation:** "In general, I expect it's easy for us to support that as well"

**Process for Option B:**
- Take existing Q1 data
- Add Q2 spend to same project
- Same suppliers merge into same rows

**Sub-Question 3b: 10k Threshold Logic with Quarterly Data**

**Valerie's Concern:**
- More rows with <10k spend after Q1 than at end of year
- As spend accumulates throughout year, suppliers may cross 10k threshold
- **If quarterly files submitted:** How does 10k threshold apply each quarter?
- **Issue:** Suppliers dropping out of "Other Expenses" into their own rows each quarter (confusing)

**Alex's Suggestion:** Might want to wait until end of year to apply consolidation

**Rationale:** Avoid suppliers moving in/out of "Other Expenses" category each quarter

**Counter-Point (Alex):** Could do consolidation each quarter if helpful for Coherent's view

**Valerie's Response:**
- **Consolidation is helpful** - avoids thousands of extra rows
- **Current focus:** Not on tail spend (small suppliers)
- **Preference:** Consolidate tail suppliers into fewer rows

**Alex's Clarification:**
- Could apply 10k threshold to Q1 only (partial year)
- Would limit to suppliers Coherent already spending decent amount with (in Q1)
- Everything else → "Other Expenses"
- **Alternative:** Different threshold for partial year?

**Valerie's Decision:** "I think we should keep the 10,000 for now"

**Richard's Confirmation:** "Seems reasonable to me"

**Alex's Summary:**
- **One rule for all submissions:** £10k threshold (BU + L2 consolidation)
- Never have to think about it again
- Simplicity preferred

**Agreed Approach:**
- £10,000 threshold applies to Q1 2026 (even though partial year)
- BU + L2 consolidation logic
- Same methodology as historical data

---

### Timeline & Next Steps (23:38 - 25:03)

**Valerie's Question:** What's the timeline for Q1 2026 data ingestion?

**Alex's Response:**
- Will review file size and do first run
- **If smooth sailing:** Should take no more than 1 week
- **If questions arise:** Could push timeline out
- Will notify Valerie if complexity arises

**Valerie's Confirmation:** "Sounds good. Nothing else for me."

---

### Supplier Engagement Strategy Discussion (23:44 - 30:07)

#### Current State & Plans (Valerie)

**Category Manager Enablement:**
- Training session completed on DitchCarbon platform
- Category managers learning to:
  - Access supplier disclosure status
  - Understand supplier targets
  - Identify non-disclosing suppliers

**Chief Supply Chain Officer Presentation:**
- **Scheduled:** Next week (week of November 3rd)
- **Topics:**
  - Number of suppliers disclosing
  - Where to access information in DitchCarbon
  - Supplier engagement strategy
- **Tone:** "Extremely optimistic" - new Chief Supply Chain Officer "very supportive" in early interactions

**Supplier Outreach Letters (in Development):**

1. **Informational Letter:**
   - Message: "This is going to be expected"
   - Purpose: Set expectations for future disclosure requirements

2. **Action Request Letter:**
   - For suppliers with industry standard emissions factors only
   - Message: "You need to disclose or at least provide Coherent with information"
   - Request: Develop plan, set targets, explain actions to meet targets

**Data Collection Tool Decision (Pending):**

**Option A: Microsoft Excel Sheet (Alexa's creation)**
- Custom tracking spreadsheet
- Manual data entry
- Requires reconciliation with DitchCarbon

**Option B: DitchCarbon Supplier Claim Profile (NEW - launching today)**
- Supplier claims profile directly on DitchCarbon
- Provides data to DitchCarbon (goes through QA)
- Coherent sees data automatically in platform

**Decision Needed:** Choose between Excel vs. DitchCarbon supplier claim profile

**Current Status:** "Super early stages" of getting category managers empowered

#### Alex's Question: What Are You Showing Suppliers?

**Valerie's Answer:** "We haven't started showing them anything"

**Focus:** Enabling internal team first (category managers), then external engagement

#### Alex's Product Update: Supplier Claim Profile Feature

**Launched:** Today (October 30, 2025)

**What It Is:**
- Suppliers can "prove they are that company" (claim their profile)
- See scorecard Coherent is using to evaluate them for FREE
- See emissions data and documents DitchCarbon has on them
- Submit documents if DitchCarbon missed something
- **Key Value-Add:** Recommendations for emissions reduction

**Supplier View:**
- "Here's what Coherent is using to evaluate me"
- "Here's my scorecard"
- "Here are my emissions data"
- "Here are recommendations for what I should do to reduce"

**How It Works:**
1. Coherent sends supplier link to their profile
2. Supplier claims profile (~30 seconds)
3. Supplier sees data and recommendations (FREE)
4. Supplier uploads missing documents
5. DitchCarbon QA processes documents
6. Data added to supplier's profile

**Recommendations Feature:**
- Based on companies like them that are already reducing quickly
- Case studies from peer companies
- Actionable guidance: "Here's what you should do to improve"
- **Benefit:** Suppliers get value from engagement (not just data request)

**Comparison to Excel Sheet:**
- Excel = manual tracking, separate from DitchCarbon, requires reconciliation
- Supplier Claim Profile = one source of truth, automated data ingestion, direct integration

**Alex's Question:** "Does that make sense for us to talk about further at this stage? Or how do you see that fitting into the overall plan?"

**Valerie's Response:** "I think it would be great to explore that"

**Alex's Commitment:**
- Send demo video publicly later today (Oct 30)
- Show how supplier would use the claim profile
- Provide access links for suppliers (when Coherent ready)

**Valerie's Enthusiasm:** "The more we can do with the tool and have just one source of truth and one process, that's great"

---

### Closing & Relationship Tone (30:07 - 30:53)

**Alex:**
- "Spreadsheets may be with us until the singularity, but we hope not"
- "To the extent that we don't need them, we don't want to use them"

**Next Steps:**
- Alex will send demo video later today
- DitchCarbon will notify Coherent if questions arise during Q1 2026 data processing

**Richard's Closing to New Team Members:**
- "Welcome to Veronica and Mocha. Glad to have you on the team."
- "It's been a good partnership so far."

**Context on Current Phase:**
- **Lull period:** Not peak reporting season
- **Focus:** Routine updates, process optimization
- **Things will heat up:** Next year's reporting cycle
- **Goal:** "Make sure we got the processes for the routine updates running like a well-oiled machine"

**Valerie's Current Work:**
- "Working furiously to actually engage with the suppliers to push for emissions reduction"
- Baseline data established → now pushing for actual reductions
- **Challenge:** "Whether we're trending in the right direction fast enough"

**Customer Pressure (Richard):**
- "Under a tremendous amount of customer pressure to get Scope 3 emissions down pretty fast"

**DitchCarbon's Role:**
- Measure aggregate progress
- Track whether trending in right direction
- Help demonstrate progress to customers

**Tone:** Warm, collaborative, professional, optimistic

## Key Insights & Learnings

### Customer Success Patterns

1. **Onboarding New Team Members:**
   - Alex introduces Veronika and Varun early in call
   - Sets context for each person's role and background
   - Builds personal connection (Veronika's Emitwise background, Varun's Scope 3 research)

2. **Supplier Engagement Phasing:**
   - **Phase 1:** Internal enablement (category managers, Chief Supply Chain Officer)
   - **Phase 2:** External outreach (informational letters)
   - **Phase 3:** Action requests (disclosure, reduction plans)
   - **Rationale:** Empower internal team before external engagement

3. **Customer Pressure as Driver:**
   - "Tremendous customer pressure" creates urgency
   - Not just reporting requirement → active reduction program
   - Timeline pressure: "fast enough" is the challenge

### Product-Market Fit

4. **Supplier Claim Profile Timing:**
   - Launched exactly when Coherent evaluating supplier engagement tools
   - Addresses pain point: Excel sheet reconciliation
   - Value proposition: One source of truth + supplier value-add (recommendations)

5. **Recommendations as Engagement Tool:**
   - Suppliers more likely to engage if they get value (not just data request)
   - Case studies from peers = actionable guidance
   - Free access for suppliers = low barrier to entry

6. **CDP Workaround:**
   - CDP paywall too expensive
   - Supplier claim profile bypasses paywall
   - Proactive aggregation + supplier self-service = coverage without cost

### Data Management Strategy

7. **Partial Year Handling:**
   - Separate projects for partial years avoid misleading comparisons
   - Absolute numbers not comparable (partial vs. full year)
   - Intensity metrics still useful

8. **Consolidation Logic:**
   - £10k threshold balances detail with manageability
   - BU + L2 level = appropriate granularity for category managers
   - Consistent threshold = simplicity (don't have to rethink each time)

9. **Normalized Names:**
   - Clean supplier names from the start reduce matching issues
   - Main spend suppliers "scrubbed and super clean"
   - Tail-end suppliers may have 1-2 changes (acceptable)

10. **Incremental Data Submission:**
    - Quarterly data submission acceptable
    - Merge at year-end for full-year view
    - Flexibility: Combined file (foolproof) or separate files (manageable)

### Relationship Dynamics

11. **Collaborative Decision-Making:**
    - Valerie and team thoughtful about process decisions
    - Alex asks "What's easier for you?" (customer-centric)
    - Richard confirms decisions (leadership buy-in)

12. **Transparency Builds Trust:**
    - Alex open about CDP negotiation challenges ("ridiculous amount of money")
    - Sets realistic expectations ("1 week if smooth sailing")
    - Acknowledges complexity ("If questions arise, could push timeline")

13. **Flexibility Valued:**
    - Multiple options presented (Option A/B for data submission)
    - Customer chooses approach that works best for them
    - DitchCarbon adapts to customer preferences

14. **Product Feedback Loop:**
    - Valerie's enthusiasm: "One source of truth and one process"
    - Validates product direction (supplier claim profile)
    - Alex incorporates feedback into roadmap prioritization

### Organizational Context

15. **Leadership Support Critical:**
    - New Chief Supply Chain Officer = program accelerator
    - Presentation to executive = strategic alignment
    - "Extremely optimistic" tone reflects strong sponsor

16. **Category Manager Model:**
    - Decentralized execution requires training and enablement
    - Category managers need to understand disclosure status, targets, gaps
    - Platform must simplify view (filter clutter, focus on their suppliers)

17. **Reporting vs. Reduction:**
    - Baseline established (reporting complete)
    - Now shifting to reduction program (engagement, targets, progress)
    - Measurement role: Track aggregate progress, demonstrate trends
