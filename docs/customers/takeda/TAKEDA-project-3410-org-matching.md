## QA Methodology (from Veronika's Tutorial Video)

### Why Entity Resolution QA is Critical

**"If we got the wrong company, we'll end up missing data, we'll end up showing the customer the wrong company. It's a bad mistake for us to make."**

- Entity resolution = matching client org (user request) â†’ database organization
- If this is wrong, **everything downstream is wrong**
- **Must QA matches FIRST** before any other work - otherwise have to redo all QA if matches change

### How the System Works

1. **Inputs:** Client provides name + email/website
2. **Matching Logic:** System tries to confidently match to existing org in database
3. **S&P Global Integration:** If not confident, may match to new S&P Global record
4. **Synced Status:** Orgs show as "synced" when successfully matched
5. **Parent Laddering:** System automatically goes up corporate tree to find org with data (e.g., Google UK â†’ Alphabet)

### What to Check for Each Organization

For every supplier match:

1. **Requested Organization:** What client originally provided (name, website)
2. **Matching Organization:** What our system matched to
3. **Verify match quality:**
   - Name matches (exact or reasonable parent/child)
   - Website matches
   - **S&P Global ID exists** (critical!)
   - Organization has data (documents, targets, emissions)
   - Industry looks correct

### Red Flags - Suspect Duplicate Issue

ðŸš© **Missing S&P Global ID** = HIGH PRIORITY CHECK
- Strongly suggests duplicate organization in system
- System may have matched to empty duplicate instead of org with data
- Need to search for correct version with S&P Global ID

ðŸš© **No documents/data on matched org** = Check if correct entity

ðŸš© **Website mismatch** = Verify company relationship

ðŸš© **Wrong industry** = "Spidey senses tingling" (Veronika's phrase)

ðŸš© **Short/generic names** (e.g., "AA") = Higher error risk

### Failure Modes to Watch

1. **Duplicate Organizations**
   - Old org + new S&P Global org both exist
   - System matched to wrong duplicate without data
   - Solution: Delete duplicate, move website to correct record

2. **Wrong Parent/Child Matching**
   - Should match to entity with data (may need to ladder up tree)
   - Check corporate hierarchy to verify correct level

3. **Outdated Ownership Data**
   - S&P may show old parent companies
   - Verify current ownership with web search if suspicious

4. **Website on Wrong Organization**
   - May cause future incorrect matches
   - Update correct org, remove from incorrect one

5. **Documents on Wrong Organization**
   - Move documents to correct org
   - Lock documents so web crawlers don't move them back

### Remediation Actions (Complex Cases)

**When you find duplicate org issue:**
1. Search for organization with S&P Global ID
2. Verify it has data (documents, targets)
3. Delete duplicate organization (via Madman)
4. Move website to correct record
5. Move documents to correct organization
6. Lock documents to prevent future issues
7. System will auto re-sync to correct org

**When to ask for help:**
- Complex ownership structures (spin-outs, financial owners)
- Multiple potential matches
- Unclear which parent level to use
- When unsure about remediation actions

## Task Checklist - Before Sending to Research

### âœ… Pre-Research QA Checklist

**From Notion "Before sending checklist":**

- [ ] **Check Client Inputs:** Review what Takeda originally provided
- [ ] **Unique Suppliers Match:** Does the count of unique suppliers match the client input?
- [ ] **Match Quality Review:** Verify Client Org â†’ Database Org matches are accurate
- [ ] **Duplicate Org Check:** Confirm all matched orgs have S&P Global IDs (flag missing IDs)
- [ ] **SBTi/CDP Status QA:** Has SBTi/CDP status been QAed?
  - Use GPT to check large organizations
  - Especially focus on ones with Europe HQs
- [ ] **Industry Mappings QA:** Have industry mappings been QAed?
  - Sort by largest industry EF (Emission Factor)
  - Check those first
- [ ] **Organization Emission Factors QA:** Have organization emission factors been QAed?
  - Sort by largest upstream and scope 1+2 EFs
  - Check those first
