## Scope 3 Emissions Strategy

### Supplier Engagement Focus

**Key Challenge:**
> "A lack of transparency into, and a difficulty measuring, actual Scope 3 emissions remains an important challenge to overcome."

**2024 Supplier Target:**
- **67% of suppliers** to establish science-based emissions targets by 2024
- Working with key suppliers to set carbon reduction goals
- Supporting suppliers in taking action aligned with their targets

**Industry Collaboration:**
- **Energize Program:** Partnership with 19 global pharmaceutical companies
- **Goal:** Engage suppliers in climate action and decarbonization
- **Focus:** Renewable energy procurement across pharmaceutical value chain

### Why This Matters for Our Work

Takeda's supplier list (34 organizations in this project) represents their **upstream Scope 3 emissions**:
- Purchased goods and services
- Capital goods
- Upstream transportation
- Manufacturing inputs (lab equipment, pharma ingredients, packaging, logistics)

**Our QA validates the foundation** for Takeda's supplier engagement and emissions measurement strategy.

## Strategic Insights

### Why This Supplier List Matters

**Pharmaceutical value chain complexity:**
- Highly specialized suppliers (CDMOs, CROs, lab equipment)
- Geographically distributed (US, Europe, Asia - especially Japan/China partnerships)
- High emissions intensity (manufacturing, cold chain logistics, specialized equipment)
- Long-term partnerships (pharma suppliers = multi-year contracts)

**Supplier engagement leverage:**
- Many suppliers serve multiple pharma companies
- Energize Program = collective bargaining power
- Industry-wide standards emerging (SBTi for pharma supply chain)

**Data quality critical:**
- Wrong entity match = wrong emissions data
- Pharmaceutical precision culture = high expectations for accuracy
- Regulatory scrutiny on climate claims = need bulletproof data
